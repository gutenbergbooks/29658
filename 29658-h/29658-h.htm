<h2><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE"></a>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">That</span> Florence, the &ldquo;Flower City,&rdquo; receives only a passing
allusion in this record of various impressions that
gleam and glow through the days after several visits to
the Magic Land, is due to the fact that in a previous
volume by the writer&mdash;one entitled &ldquo;The Florence of
Landor&rdquo;&mdash;the lovely Tuscan town with its art, its
ineffable beauty, and its choice social life, formed the
subject matter of that volume. Any attempt to portray
Florence in the present book would savor only of the
repetition of loves and enthusiasms already recorded in
the previous work in which Walter Savage Landor formed
the central figure. For that reason no mention of Florence,
beyond some mere allusion, is attempted in these
pages, which only aim to present certain fragmentary
impressions of various sojourns in Italy, refracted through
the prism of memory. Whatever inconveniences or discomfort
attend the traveller swiftly fade, and leave to him
only the precious heritage of resplendent sunset skies, of
poetic association, of artistic beauty. In spirit he is
again lingering through long afternoons in St. Peter&rsquo;s
till the golden light through the far windows of the
tribune is merged into the dusk of twilight in which
the vast monumental groups gleam wraith-like. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
he is ascending the magnificent <i>Scala Regia</i>, and lingering
in the Raphael Stanze, or in the wonderful sculpture
galleries of the Vatican, or sauntering in the sunshine
on the Palatine. In memory he is again spellbound by
ancient and medi√¶val art. In the line of modern
sculpture the work of Franklin Simmons in Rome is
a feature of Italy that haunts the imagination. No
lover of beauty would willingly miss his great studios
in the Via San Nicolo da Tolentino, with their wealth of
ideal creations that contribute new interest to the most
divine of all the arts.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The world of art is an ideal world,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world I love, and that I fain would live in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So speak to me of artists and of art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the painters, sculptors, and musicians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now illustrate Rome.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mystic charm of the pilgrimage to Assisi; the
romance that reflects itself in the violet seas and flaming
splendors of the sky on the shores of Ischia and Capri;
the buried treasures of Amalfi; the magnetic impressiveness
of the Eternal City,&mdash;all these enter into life as new
forces to build and shape the future into undreamed-of
destinies.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Rome</span>, as the picturesque city of the Popes in
the middle years of the nineteenth century, was
resplendent in local color. It was the Rome
of sunny winters; the Rome of gay excursions
over that haunted sea of the Campagna to
pictorial points in the Alban and Sabine hills;
the Rome of young artist life, which organized
impromptu festas with Arcadian freedom, and
utilized the shadow or the shelter of ruined
temples or tombs in which to spread its picnic
lunches and bring the glow of simple, friendly
intercourse into the romantic lights of the
poetic, historic, or tragic past. There were
splendid Catholic processions and ceremonials
that seemed organized as a part of the stage
scenery that ensconced itself, also, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
nonchalance of easy possession, in the vast
salons of historic palaces where tapestried walls
and richly painted ceilings, arched high overhead,
with statues dimly seen in niches here
and there, and the bust of some crowned Antoninus,
or radiant Juno, gleaming from a
shadowy corner, all made up the <i>mise-en-sc√®ne</i>
of familiar evenings. There were lingering
hours in the gardens of the Villa Medici into
whose shades one strolled by that beguiling
path along the parapet on Monte Pincio,
through the beautiful grove with its walks and
fountains. The old ilex bosquet, with its
tangled growth and air of complete seclusion,
had its spell of fascination. Then, as now, the
elevated temple, at the end of the main path,
seemed the haunt of gods and muses. In all
the incidental, as well as the ceremonial social
meeting and mingling, art and religion were the
general themes of discussion. This idyllic life&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Comprehending, too, the soul&rsquo;s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the high necessities of art&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">has left its impress on the air as well as its
record on many a page of the poet and the
romancist. The names that made memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
those wonderful days touch chords of association
that still vibrate in the life of the hour.
For the most part the artists and their associates
have gone their way&mdash;not into a Silent
Land, a land of shadows and vague, wandering
ghosts&mdash;but into that realm wherein is the
&ldquo;life more abundant,&rdquo; of more intense energy
and of nobler achievement; the realm in which
every aspiration of earth enlarges its conception
and every inspiration is exalted and endowed
with new purpose; the realm where, as
Browning says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Power comes in full play.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet&rsquo;s vision recognizes the truth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I know there shall dawn a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&mdash;Is it here on homely earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it yonder, worlds away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where the strange and new have birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Power comes in full play?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The names of sculptor, painter, and poet
throng back, imaged in that retrospective mirror
which reflects a vista of the past, rich in ideal
creation. Beautiful forms emerge from the
marble; pictorial scenes glow from the canvas;
song and story and happy, historic days are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the very air. To Italy, land of romance and
song, all the artists came trooping, and</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Under many a yellow Star&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">they dropped into the Magic Land. If the
wraiths of the centuries long since dead walked
the streets, they were quite welcome to revisit
the glimpses of the moon and contribute their
mystery to the general artistic effectiveness of
the Seven-hilled City. All this group of American
idealists, from Allston and Page to Crawford,
Story, Randolph Rogers, Vedder, Simmons,
and to the latest comer of all, Charles Walter
Stetson, recognized something of the artist&rsquo;s
native air in this Mecca of their pilgrimage.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, quite natural, on account of
the stupendous work of Michael Angelo and
the unrivalled museums of the Vatican, that
Rome should have become pre-eminently the
artistic centre of the <a name="tn6" id="tn6"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'ninteenth'">nineteenth</ins> century and
should have attracted students and lovers of art
from all parts of the world. The immortal
works of the two great periods, the Greek and
the Renaissance,&mdash;the art that was forever
great because it was the outgrowth of profound
religious conviction,&mdash;were enshrined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
churches and the galleries of Rome. The leading
countries of Europe sent here their aspiring
students and established permanent academies
for their residence. Germany, France, and
England were thus represented. Thorwaldsen
came as a pensioner from the Academy of Fine
Arts in Copenhagen; and it was during his life,
and that of the noble Canova, that Rome began
to be recognized as the modern world-centre of
art. Was it not a natural sequence that the
early painters and sculptors who came to study
under the stimulating influences of the great
masterpieces of the past should linger on in
the city whose very air became to them the
breath of inspiring suggestion? Where but in
Rome would have come to Crawford the vision
of his &ldquo;Orpheus&rdquo; and of his noble Beethoven?
or to Story his &ldquo;Libyan Sibyl,&rdquo; and that exquisite
group, &ldquo;Into the Silent Land&rdquo;? or to Vedder
his marvellous creations of &ldquo;The Fates Gathering
in the Stars,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Cum√¶an Sibyl,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Dance of the Pleiades&rdquo;? to Simmons his triumphant
&ldquo;Angel of the Resurrection,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Genius of Progress Leading the Nations&rdquo;?
or to Stetson that ineffable vision of
&ldquo;The Child,&rdquo; and that wonderful group called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
&ldquo;Music&rdquo;? whose coloring Titian or Giorgione
might well mistake for their own.</p>

<p>Under the Pontifical <i>r√©gime</i> the general character
of Rome was medi√¶val and religious.
The perpetual festas of the church made the
streets constantly picturesque with their processions
of monks, and friars, and priests, and
these wonderful blendings of color and scenic
effect stimulated the artistic sense. The expenses
of living in Rome were then only a fraction
of what the cost is at the present time; and
as the city was the resort of the wealthy and
cultured few, the artists were surrounded by the
stimulus of critical appreciation and of patronage.
Their work, their dreams, were the theme
of literary discussion, and focussed the attention
of the polite world. Their studios were among
the important interests to every visitor in the
Eternal City. In those days the traveller did
not land with his touring car at Naples, make
&ldquo;the run&rdquo; to Rome in a record that distanced
any possibilities of railroad trains, pass two or
three days in motoring about the city and its
environs, seeing the exterior of everything in a
dissolving view and the interior of nothing,&mdash;as
within this time, at least, he must flash on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in his touring car to Florence. On the contrary,
the traveller proceeded to Rome with
serious deliberation, and with a more realizing
sense of undertaking a journey than Walter
Wellman experiences in attempting to fly in
his aero-car to the North Pole and send his
observations across the polar seas by wireless
telegraphy. The visitor went to Rome for a
winter, for a year, and gave himself up to
leisurely impressions. Rome was an atmosphere,
not a spectacle, and it was to be entered
with the lofty and reverent appreciation of the
poet&rsquo;s power and the artist&rsquo;s vision.</p>

<p>In Rome, Thomas Cole painted some of his
best pictures; and in Rome or Florence wrought
a long list of painters and sculptors. Whether
in the Eternal City or in the Flower City, their
environment was alike Italy&mdash;the environment of
the Magic Land. Among the more prominent
of all these devotees of Beauty several nationalities
were represented. Each might have said of
his purpose, in the words of William Watson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I follow Beauty; of her train am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beauty, whose voice is earth and sea and air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who serveth, and her hands for all things ply;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who reigneth, and her throne is everywhere.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Among these artists there flash upon memory
the names of Vanderlyn, Benjamin West, Allston,
Rauch, Ange, Veit, Tenerani, Overbeck,
Schadow, Horace Vernet, Thorwaldsen, John
Gibson, Hiram Powers, Crawford, Page, Clark
Mills, Randolph Rogers, William Rinehart,
Launt Thompson, Horatio and Richard Greenough,
Thomas Ball, Anne Whitney, Larkin G.
Mead, Paul Akers, William Wetmore Story,
Harriet Hosmer, J. Rollin Tilton, and, later,
Elihu Vedder, Moses Ezekiel, Franklin Simmons,
Augustus St. Gaudens, and Charles
Walter Stetson, the name of Mr. Stetson linking
the long and interesting procession with the
immediate life of to-day. Of these later artists
Story, Miss Hosmer, Ezekiel, Vedder, Simmons,
and Stetson are identified with Rome as being
either their permanent or their prolonged residence.
Mr. St. Gaudens was a transient student,
returning to his own country to pursue
his work; and of two young sculptors, Hendrick
Christian Anderson and C. Percival Dietsch,
time has not yet developed their powers beyond
an experimental stage of brilliant promise.</p>

<p>The Rome of the artists of clay and canvas
was also the Rome of the poets and romancists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of authors in all lines of literary achievement.
How the names of the procession of visitors and
sojourners in the Eternal City, from Milton,
Goethe, and Mme. de Sta√´l to Henry James,
Marion Crawford, Richard Bagot, and Grace
Ellery Channing (Mrs. Charles Walter Stetson),
gleam from that resplendent panorama of the
modern past of Rome! Like the words in
electric fire that flash out of the darkness in
city streets at night, there shine the names of
Shelley and of Keats; of Gladstone, on whom
in one memorable summer day, while strolling
in Italian sunshine, there fell a vision of the
sacredness and the significance of life and its
infinite responsibility in the fulfilment of lofty
purposes. What charming associations these
guests and sojourners have left behind! Hawthorne,
embodying in immortal romance the
spirit of the scenic greatness of the Eternal
City; Margaret Fuller, Marchesa d&rsquo;Ossoli, allying
herself in marriage with the country she
loved, and living in Rome those troubled,
mysterious years that were to close the earthly
chapter of her life; Robert and Elizabeth
Browning, the wedded poets, who sang of love
and Italy; Harriet Beecher Stowe, finding on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the enchanted Italian shores the material which
she wove with such irresistible attraction into
the romance of &ldquo;Agnes of Sorrento;&rdquo; Longfellow,
with his poet&rsquo;s vision, transmuting every
vista and impression into some exquisite lyric;
Lowell, bringing his philosophic as well as his
poetic insight to penetrate the untold meaning
of Rome; Thomas William Parsons, making the
country of Dante fairly his own; Thackeray,
with his brilliant interpretation of the <i>com√©die
humaine</i>; Emerson, who, oblivious of all the
glories of art or the joys of nature, absorbed
himself in writing transcendental letters to his
eccentric, but high-souled aunt, Mary Moody
Emerson; Ruskin, translating Italian art to
Italy herself; Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe and
his poet wife, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, in the
first flush of their bridal happiness, when Mrs.
Howe&rsquo;s impassioned love for the Seven-hilled
City inspired many a lyric that mirrors the
Roman atmosphere of that day; Kate Field,
with a young girl&rsquo;s glad enthusiasm over the
marvellous loveliness of a Maytime in Rome,
and her devotion to those great histrionic
artists, Ristori and Salvini; George Stillman
Hillard, leaving to literature the rich legacy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his &ldquo;Six Months in Italy,&rdquo;&mdash;a work that to
this day holds precedence as a clear and comprehensive
presentation of the scenic beauty,
the notable monumental and architectural art,
and the general life and resources of this land
of painter and poet. Other names, too, throng
upon memory&mdash;that of William Dean Howells,
painting Italian life in his &ldquo;Venetian Days,&rdquo;
and charming all the literary world by his
choice art; and among later work, the interesting
interpretations of Rome and of social life
in Rome, by Marion Crawford, Henry James,
and Richard Bagot,&mdash;in chronicle, in romance,
or in biographical record. During the last
quarter of the nineteenth century, indeed, the
visitors to Rome&mdash;authors, artists, travellers of
easy leisure&mdash;defy any numerical record. Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton, poet, romancist, and
delightful <i>raconteur</i> as well, has recorded some
charming impressions of her various sojourns
in Rome both in her &ldquo;Random Rambles&rdquo; and
in &ldquo;Lazy Tours.&rdquo; Of the Palatine Hill we
find her saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Sometimes we go to the Palace of the
C√¶sars, and look off upon the heights where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the snow lingers and the warm light rests,
making them shine like the Delectable Mountains.
Nearer at hand are the almond trees,
in flower, or the orange trees, bright at once
with their white, sweet blossoms and their
golden fruit.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Moulton writes of the &ldquo;stately dwellers&rdquo;
in Rome whom time cannot change; and to
whom, whenever she returns, she makes her
first visit; some of whom are in the mighty
palace of the Vatican and some of whom dwell
in state in the Capitol.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The beautiful Antoninus still wears his
crown of lotus in Villa Albani and the Juno
whom Goethe worshipped reigns forever at the
Ludovisi,&rdquo; she writes; &ldquo;I can never put in
words the pleasure I find in these immortals.&rdquo;
Mrs. Moulton loved to wander in the Villa
Borghese &ldquo;before the place is thronged with
the beauty and fashion of Rome as it is in the
late afternoon. I do not wonder that Miriam
and Donatello could forget their fate in these
enchanted glades,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and dance as
the sunbeams danced with the shadows. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
I seem to see them where the sun sifts
through the young green leaves, and her beauty&mdash;her
human, deep-souled beauty&mdash;and his
fantastic grace are the only things here that
cannot change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The walls will crumble; the busts of kings
and heroes and poets will lose their contours,
the lovely Roman ladies also grow old and
fade, and vanish from sight and from memory;
but still these two, hopeless yet happy, will
dance in these wild glades immortally beyond
the reach of the effacing years.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The visit to Rome of the Rev. Dr. Phillips
Brooks&mdash;later the Bishop of Massachusetts&mdash;is
immortalized in the most lifelike portrait
bust of the great preacher ever modelled; a
bust in which the genius of the sculptor, Franklin
Simmons, found one of its noblest expressions,
and has perpetuated, with masterly
power, the energy of thought, at once profound
and intense, in the countenance of Bishop
Brooks. These, and many another whom the
gods have loved and dowered with gifts, rise
before any retrospective glance over the comparatively
recent past of Rome. Bishop Brooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
passed there the Holy Week of one Lenten
season, and of the Miserere in the Sistine
Chapel he wrote that it was certainly the most
wonderful music to which he had ever listened;
and he added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Miserere in the Sistine, the Benediction
from the balcony, the solemn moment of
the elevation of the Host on Easter, and the
illumination of St. Peter&rsquo;s, these all seem to
reach very remarkably the great ideal of the
central religious commemoration of Christendom.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was in the winter of 1828 that Mr. Longfellow
first visited Rome, which &ldquo;is announced,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;by Nero&rsquo;s tomb,&rdquo; and he quotes
Dupaty&rsquo;s lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Quoi! c&rsquo;est l√† Rome? quoi!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&rsquo;est le tombeau de Neron qui l&rsquo;annonce.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Longfellow expressed his love for the
Eternal City, and in a personal letter<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he
said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I have been so delighted with Rome that I
have extended my residence much beyond my
original intention. There is so much in the
city to delay the stranger; the villages in the
environs are so beautiful, and there is such a
quiet and stillness about everything that, were
it in my power, I should be induced to remain
the whole year round. You can imagine nothing
equal to the ruins of Rome. The Forum
and the Coliseum are beyond all I had ever
fancied them; and the ruined temples and
the mouldering aqueducts which are scattered
over the Campagna; I do not believe there is a
finer view in the world than that from the
eastern gate of the city, embracing the Campagna,
with its ruined aqueducts diverging in
long broken arcades, and terminated by the
sweep of the Albanian hills, sprinkled with their
white villages, and celebrated in song and story!
But the great charm of the scene springs from
association; and though everything in Italy is
really picturesque, yet strip the country of its
historic recollections,&mdash;think merely of what
it is, and not of what it has been,&mdash;and you will
find the dream to be fading away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be shocked at the misery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
people, especially in the Pope&rsquo;s dominions: but
their element seems to be in rags and misery;
and with the ceremonials of their religion and
the holidays of the church, which average nearly
three a week, they are poor&mdash;and lazy and
happy. I mean, happy in their way.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In a later visit the poet was domiciled in an
hotel on the Piazza Barberini, where the wonderful
view included then the entire city &ldquo;to where
St. Peter&rsquo;s dome darkens against the sunset.&rdquo;
Of this visit his brother, Rev. Samuel Longfellow,
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Here Mr. Longfellow became for the season
the centre of the group of American visitors
and resident artists, whose well-known names
need not be recounted. Here he made, also,
acquaintances among the Italians,&mdash;especially
the Duke of Sermoneta, the Dantean scholar,
and Monsignore Nardi, of the papal court.
The Pope himself he did not visit. An interesting
acquaintance was that made with the
Abb√© Liszt, who was spending the winter in
Rome, having rooms in the abandoned Convent
of Santa Francesca, in the Forum. Calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
there one evening, in company with Mr.
Healy the artist, the inner door of the apartment
was opened to them by Liszt himself, holding
high in his hand a candle which illuminated his
fine face. The picture was so striking that Mr.
Longfellow begged his companion to put it
upon canvas,&mdash;which he did; and the painting
now hangs in the library of Craigie House.
At a morning visit, Liszt delighted the party
with a performance upon his Chickering pianoforte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see Rome, as all travellers know, is a
work for many months; and it was pursued with
tolerable diligence. But Mr. Longfellow was
never a good sight-seer. He was impatient of
lingering in picture galleries, churches, or ruins.
He saw quickly the essential points, and soon
tired of any minuter examination.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>But long, indeed, before nineteenth-century
artists and authors laid siege to the Eternal
City, in the far-away years of 1638, Milton
visited Rome, and there still remains the tablet,
on the wall of the <i>casa</i> in the Via delle <a name="tn19" id="tn19"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Quattre'">Quattro</ins>
Fontane in which he stayed, a tablet bearing
an inscription giving the date of his visit; as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
also, in Via Machella, there is an inscription
marking the place where Scott lived during his
visit to Rome. Goethe made his memorable
tour to Italy in 1786&mdash;fourteen years before the
dawn of the nineteenth century&mdash;and wrote:
&ldquo;I feel the greatest longing to read Tacitus
in Rome;&rdquo; and again (an observation with
which every visitor to the Eternal City will
sympathize) he noted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It grows more and more difficult for me to
render an account of my residence in Rome, for
as we always find the sea deeper the further we
go, so it is with me in observation of this
city.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wherever we go and wherever we
stand, we see about us a finished picture,&mdash;forms
of every kind and style; palaces and
ruins; gardens and wastes; the distant and the
near houses; triumphal arches and columns,&mdash;often
all so close together that they might be
sketched on a single sheet. One should have a
thousand points of steel with which to write,
and what can a single pen do? and then in the
evening one is weary and exhausted with the
day of seeing and admiring. Here one reads
history from within outward.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Chateaubriand, who in his earliest youth
had visited America as the guest of Washington,
passed the winter of 1803-4 in Rome, and
his pictorial transcriptions of the city and its
environs are among the most exquisite things
in literary record. As, for instance, this description
of a sunset from Monte Mario:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I was never weary of seeing, from the Villa
Borghese, the sun go down behind the cypresses
of Monte Mario, and the pines of the Villa
Pamphili planted by Le Notre. I have stood
upon the Ponte Molle to enjoy the sublime
spectacle of the close of day. The summits of
the Sabine hills appeared of lapis lazuli and
pale gold, while their bases and sides were
bathed in vapors of violet or purple. Sometimes
lovely clouds, like fairy cars, borne along
by the evening wind with inimitable grace, recall
the mythological tales of the descent of the
deities of Olympus. Sometimes old Rome
seems to have spread all over the west the
purple of her consuls and her C√¶sars, beneath
the last steps of the god of day. This rich
decoration does not vanish so quickly as in our
climate. When we think the hues are about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to disappear they revive on some other point of
the horizon; one twilight follows another and
the magic of sunset is prolonged.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was in the same year that Mme. de Sta√´l
visited Rome and recorded, in her glowing
romance, &ldquo;Corinne,&rdquo; the impressions she received.
In the spring of 1817 Lord Byron
found in Rome the inspiration that he transmitted
into that wonderful line in &ldquo;Childe
Harold&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Niobe of Nations! There she stands.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was two years later that Shelley passed
the spring in the Seven-hilled City, retiring to
Leghorn later, to write his tragedy of &ldquo;The
Cenci.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Rome the visitor follows Michael Angelo
and Raphael through the various churches and
museums. The celebrated sibyls of Raphael are
in the Santa Maria della Pace; his &ldquo;Isaiah&rdquo; is in
San Agostino and his &ldquo;Entombment&rdquo; in the
Casino of the Villa Borghese. While the sublime
work of Michael Angelo in the Sistine
Chapel is always one of the first things in Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to which the traveller goes to study that incomparable
work portraying the Creation&mdash;the
Prophets and the Sibyls, the Angels and the
Genii, that record the impassioned power of
the master&mdash;yet all footsteps turn quickly, too,
to the church called San Pietro in Vincoli, near
the house in which Lucrezia Borgia lived, in
which is the colossal Moses of Michael Angelo.
As it stands, it fails to convey the first design
of the great sculptor. Originally intended for
the tomb of Pope Julius II, the plan included
a massive block of marble (some forty by twenty
feet) surmounted by a cornice and having its
niches, its columns, and its statues, of which
the Moses was to have been one. It would
then have been judged relatively to the entire
group, while now it is seen alone, and thus out
of the proportions that were in the mind of the
artist. The entire conception, indeed, was to
unite sculpture and architecture into one splendid
combination. &ldquo;Thus the statue of Moses
was meant to have been raised considerably
above the eye of the spectator,&rdquo; writes Mr.
Hillard, &ldquo;and to have been a single object in a
colossal structure of architecture and sculpture,
which would have had a foreground and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
background, and been crowned with a mass at
once dome-like and pyramidal. Torn, as it is,
from its proper place; divorced from its proportionate
companionship; stuck against the
wall of a church; and brought face to face with
the observer,&mdash;what wonder that so many of
those who see it turn away with no other impressions
than those of caricature and exaggeration!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hillard adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;But who that can appreciate the sublime
in art will fail to bow down before it as
embodied in this wonderful statue? The majestic
character of the head, the prodigious
muscles of the chest and arms, and the beard
that flows like a torrent to the waist, represent
a being of more than mortal port and
power, speaking with the authority, and frowning
with the sanctions of incarnate law. The
drapery of the lower part of the figure is inferior
to the anatomy of the upper part. Remarkable
as the execution of the statue is, the expression
is yet more so; for notwithstanding its colossal
proportions, its prominent characteristic is the
embodiment of intellectual power. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
great leader and lawgiver of his people that we
see, whose voice was command, and whose outstretched
arm sustained a nation&rsquo;s infant steps.
He looks as if he might control the energies of
nature as well as shape the mould in which the
character of his people should be formed. That
any one should stand before this statue in a
scoffing mood is to me perfectly inexplicable.
My own emotions were more nearly akin to
absolute bodily fear. At an irreverent word, I
should have expected the brow to contract into
a darker frown, and the marble lips to unclose
in rebuke.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>William Watson condenses his impressions of
this majestic sculpture in the following quatrain.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s might, and mystery of the seer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Remoteness of Jehovah&rsquo;s colloquist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearness of man&rsquo;s heaven-advocate&mdash;are here:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Alone Mount Nebo&rsquo;s harsh foreshadow is miss&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The impressive group of sculptures and buildings
on the Campidoglio&mdash;where once the
shrine of Jupiter Capitolinus stood&mdash;owes its
present picturesque scheme largely to Michael
Angelo. The fascination of the long flights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
steps leading from the Piazza Arac√∂eli to the
Capitoline, where the ancient bronze equestrian
statue of Marcus Aurelius forever keeps guard,
is indescribable. The historic statues of Castor
and Pollux mark the portals; on either hand
there are seen the Muses of ancient sculpture,
the Palazzo <a name="tn26" id="tn26"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Sentoriale and the Palazzo dei Conservatore'">Senatoriale and the Palazzo dei
Conservatori</ins>. There is in the entire world
no more classic ground than is found in this
impressive grouping of art and architecture.</p>

<p>The genius of Raphael has recorded itself in
those brilliant and imperishable works that enthrall
the student of art in the Raphael stanze in
the Vatican. He was imbued with the spirit
of Greek art, and while Titian is a greater colorist,
while Correggio, Botticelli, Perugino, and
other artists that could be named equal or exceed
Raphael in certain lines, yet as the interpreter
of the profoundest thought, and for his
philosophic grasp and his power to endow his
conceptions with the most brilliant animation,
he stands alone. The religious exaltation of
&ldquo;The Transfiguration&rdquo; reveals the supreme degree
of the divine genius of Raphael. That
this painting was the last work of his life, that
it was placed above his body as it lay in state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and was carried in his funeral procession, invests
it with peculiar interest.</p>

<p>As a draftsman Raphael was second only to
Michael Angelo, with whom he must forever
share the immortality of fame. The Academy
in Venice holds some of his choicest drawings,
and in the Venetian sketch-book in the National
Gallery in London are many of his small
pictures, including that of the &ldquo;Knight&rsquo;s
Dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1508, when Raphael
was in his twenty-fifth year, that he was called
to Rome in the service of the Pope. The Pontiff
at this time was Pope Julius II, whose successor
was Leo X, and under their pontificates
(from 1508 to 1520) Raphael produced these
masterpieces which stand unrivalled in the world
save by the creations of Michael Angelo in the
Capella Sistina. The celebrated &ldquo;Four Sibyls&rdquo;
of Raphael are not, however, in the stanze of
the Vatican, but in the Church of San Maria
della Pace. In the Palazzo Vaticano these four
wonderful stanze entrance the visitor; the
Stanza della Signatura, the Stanza d&rsquo;Eliodoro,
the Stanza <a name="tn27" id="tn27"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'della Incendio'">dell&rsquo;Incendio</ins> and the Sala di Constantino.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>For the decoration of these stanze several
painters from Umbria had been summoned,&mdash;Perugino,
Sodoma, Signorelli, and others; but
when Raphael had produced the &ldquo;Disputa&rdquo; in
the Sala della Signatura, Pope Julius II recognized
the work as so transcendent that he
ordered the other artists to cease and even had
some of their paintings obliterated that there
might be more space for the exercise of
Raphael&rsquo;s genius. In the &ldquo;Disputa&rdquo; are glorified
the highest expressions of the human intellect&mdash;the
domain portrayed being that of Theology,
Philosophy, Poetry, and Justice. The
splendor of this creation transcends all attempts
of interpretation in language. Against a background
of gold mosaic are portrayed these typical
figures enthroned on clouds where genii flit
to and fro bearing tablets with inscriptions.
Theology holds in the left hand a book, while
the other points to the vision of angels; Poetry,
laurel-crowned, is seen seated on a throne
with books and lyre; Philosophy wears a diadem,
and Justice, with her balance and her
sword, is also crowned. The title of this marvellous
work is misleading. Its message is
not that of disputation but of beatitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
At the altar are grouped the congregation;
the mystic spell of heavenly enthusiasm enfolds
the scene as an atmosphere, as above
the heavens open and the glorified Christ,
surrounded by the saints who have kept the
faith, is disclosed to the devotees kneeling
below, while a choir of listening angels bend
over them from the distant clouds in the background.</p>

<p>Under Poetry are grouped Apollo and the
Muses, and the figures of Homer, Dante and
Virgil, of Petrarcha, Anacreon and Sappho, of
Pindar and of Horace are recognized. The great
scholars seen in the Philosophy include Plato
and Aristotle, while in the groups under Justice,
Moses and Solon are seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raphael seems to have never known
despair,&rdquo; remarked Franklin Simmons of the
work of this divine genius. &ldquo;His paintings reveal
no struggle, but seem to have been produced
without effort, as if brought into existence
by an enchanter&rsquo;s wand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No observation could more vividly interpret
the wonderful effect produced on the student
by Raphael, and he cannot but recall the truth
expressed in these lines of Festus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&ldquo;All aspiration is a toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But inspiration cometh from above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is no labor.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The inspiration of Raphael was of the noblest
order. His genius, his kindling enthusiasm, his
ecstasy of religious devotion, have left an imperishable
heritage to art. By his transcendent
gifts he represents the highest manifestation
of the art of painting in the Renaissance. For
the true note in art lies in spiritual perception.
Not so brilliant a colorist as Titian, he was
more the interpreter of the extension of human
activity into that realm of the life more abundant,
and with his extraordinary facility of
execution he united exquisite refinement and
unerring sense of beauty and the masterly
power in composition that fairly created for the
spectator the visions that his soul beheld. &ldquo;I
say to you,&rdquo; said Mr. Bryce recently in a press
interview,&mdash;&ldquo;I say to you, each oncoming tide
of life requires and needs men of lofty thought
who shall dream for it, sing for it, who shall
gather up its tendencies, formulate its ideals
and voice its spirit.&rdquo; One of those men of lofty
thought who thus dream for the ages was
Raphael, and his power and glory have left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
an ineffaceable impress upon human life. He
was the divinely appointed messenger of beauty,
and he was never disobedient to the heavenly
vision.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Time hath no tide but must abide<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The servant of Thy will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tide hath no time, for to Thy rhyme<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ranging stars stand still.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The decline of art after Michael Angelo and
Raphael was marked. The very splendor and
power of their creations, instead of inspiring
those who immediately followed them, produced
almost the inertia of despair. In the
reverence and awe and admiration with which
these transcendent masterpieces were approached
any power to originate seemed futile
by contrast. Imitation rather than creation
became the method adopted, resulting in an
increased poverty of design and feeble execution.
The art of the sixteenth century deteriorated
rapidly till the baroco style was in evidence.
One reason, too, for the decline was in
that art was no longer so exclusively dedicated
to the high service of religion, but aimed, instead,
to please and to procure patrons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
thus were all worthy standards lowered to pernicious
levels.</p>

<p>A sculptor who left his impress upon the
sixteenth-century art was Lorenzo Bernini, a
Neapolitan (born in 1598) who died in Rome
in 1685. The work of Bernini has a certain
fascination and airy touch that, while it sometimes
degenerates into the merely fantastic and
even into tawdry and puerile affectations, has
at its best a refinement and grace that lend to
his sculptures an enduring charm, as seen in
his &ldquo;Apollo and Daphne&rdquo; (a work executed
in his eighteenth year) which is now in the
Casino of the Villa Borghese. Bernini&rsquo;s name
is perpetuated in the colossal statues on the
colonnade of St. Peter&rsquo;s, the great bronze
angels with their draperies streaming to the
winds on the <a name="tn32a" id="tn32a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Pont'">Ponte</ins> San Angelo, and in the vast
fountain in the Piazza Navona. In the court
of the Palazzo Bernini is one of the most
interesting of his works&mdash;a colossal figure,
allegorical in significance, illustrating &ldquo;Truth
Brought to Light by Time.&rdquo; One of the most
important works of Bernini&mdash;now placed in
the <a name="tn32b" id="tn32b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Music'">Museo</ins> Nazionale&mdash;is the group of &ldquo;Pluto
and Proserpine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The influence that was to reform and regenerate
the art of sculpture in the sixteenth century
came with the great and good Canova, with
which was united that of Flaxman and of Thorwaldsen.
The heavenly messengers are always
sent and appear at the time they are most
needed. Neither Truth nor Art is ever left
without a witness.</p>

<p class="caption noi"><small>DETAIL FROM STUART MONUMENT, ST. PETER&rsquo;S, ROME<br /> Antonio Canova
</small></p>
</div>

<p>Canova&rsquo;s genius and services were widely
recognized. In 1719 he was made a Senator;
he was ennobled with the title of Marchese of
Ischia and granted a yearly allowance of three
thousand scudi; and his noble and generous
enthusiasms, not less than his genius, have left
their record on life as well as on art. When he
died (in Venice, Oct. 3, 1822) his work included
fifty-nine statues, fourteen groups,
twenty-two monuments, and fifty-four busts.
The statue of Pius V and the tomb of Clement
XIII are his greatest works, and the latter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
perhaps even increasingly held as a masterpiece
of the ages.</p>

<p>Canova, warned by the fatal influence of
imitation in art in the sixteenth century, frequently
counselled his pupils against copying
his own style and constantly urged them to study
from the Greeks. He advised them to visit
frequently the studios of other artists, &ldquo;and
especially,&rdquo; he would add, &ldquo;the studios of
Thorwaldsen, who is a very great artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century
contemporary sculpture in Rome was led by
the three great artists,&mdash;Canova, Thorwaldsen,
and Gibson. In 1829 Gibson had the honor of
being elected a member of the Accad√©mia di
San Luca in place of the sculptor Massimiliano,
who had then just died. Cammuccini, the historical
painter, proposed Gibson, and with the
ardent assistance of Thorwaldsen he was
elected resident Academician of merit. &ldquo;Like
Canova, Thorwaldsen was most generous to
young artists,&rdquo; says Gibson of the great Danish
master, &ldquo;and he freely visited all who required
his advice. I profited greatly by the knowledge
which this splendid sculptor had of his
art. On every occasion when I was modelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a new work he came to me, and corrected whatever
he thought amiss. I also often went to
his studio and contemplated his glorious works,
always in the noblest style, full of pure and
severe simplicity. His studio was a safe school
for the young, and was the resort of artists and
lovers of art from all nations. The old man&rsquo;s
person can never be forgotten by those who
saw him. Tall and strong,&mdash;he never lost a
tooth in his life,&mdash;he was most venerable looking.
His kind countenance was marked with
hard thinking, his eyes were gray, and his
white locks lay upon his broad shoulders. At
great assemblies his breast was covered with
orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen (born in Copenhagen, Nov. 19,
1770) went to Rome in 1797&mdash;sent by the
government of Denmark as a pensioner. It is
said that, in his enthusiasm for Rome, Thorwaldsen
dated his birth from the hour he entered
the Eternal City. &ldquo;Before that day,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I existed; I did not live.&rdquo; For
nearly fifty years&mdash;until his death in 1844&mdash;he
lived and worked in Rome, occupying at
one time the studio in Via Babuino that had
formerly been that of Flaxman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>John Gibson, who went to Rome in 1817,&mdash;twenty
years after Thorwaldsen first arrived,&mdash;had
the good fortune to be for five years a
pupil of Canova, whose death in 1822 terminated
this inestimable privilege. The elevation
of purpose that characterized the young
English student made his progress and development
a matter of peculiar interest to the
master. Gibson, also, bears his testimony to
the stimulus of the Roman environment.
&ldquo;Rome above all other cities,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has
a peculiar influence upon and charm for the
real student; he feels himself in the very university
of art, where it is the one thing talked
about and thought about. Constantly did I
feel the presence of this influence. Every
morning I rose with the sun, my soul gladdened
by a new day of a happy and delightful
pursuit; and as I walked to my breakfast at
the Caff√® Greco and watched with new pleasure
the tops of the churches and palaces gilt
by the morning sun, I was inspired with a
sense of daily renovated youth, and fresh enthusiasm,
and returned joyfully to the combat,
to the invigorating strife with the difficulties
of art. Nor did the worm of envy creep round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
my heart whenever I saw a beautiful idea skilfully
executed by any of my young rivals, but
constantly spurred on by the talent around me
I returned to my studio with fresh resolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again to a friend Gibson writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I renewed my visits to the Vatican, refreshing
my spirits in that Pantheon of the gods,
demigods, and heroes of Hellas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the
art of sculpture the Greeks were gods.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In the Vatican we go from statue to statue,
from fragment to fragment, like the bee from
flower to flower.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>These five years in which Canova, Thorwaldsen,
and Gibson lived and wrought together&mdash;although
the youngest of this trio was still in
his student life&mdash;form a definite period in
the history of modern art in Rome. The
dreams, the enthusiasm, the devotion to ideal
beauty which characterized their work left its
impress and its vitality of influence&mdash;a mystic
power ready to incarnate itself again through
the facility of expression of the artists yet to
come. To the young men whose steps were
turned toward Rome in these early years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the century just passed, how great was the
privilege of coming into close range of the
influence of such artists as these; to study their
methods; to hear the expression of their views
on art in familiar meeting and conversation!
These artists were closely in touch with that
&ldquo;lovely and faithful dream which came with
Italian Renaissance in the works of Pisani,
Mino di Fiesole, Donatello, Michael Angelo,
and Giovanni da Bologna&mdash;all who caught
the spirit of Greek art.&rdquo; Artistic truth was
the keynote of the hour, and it is this truth
which is the basis of the highest conception
of life.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Art&rsquo;s a service,&mdash;mark:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silver key is given to thy clasp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt stand unwearied night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To open, so that intermediate door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And form insensuous, that inferior men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May learn to feel on still through these to those,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless thy ministration. The world waits for help.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In their true relation art and ethics meet in
their ministry to humanity, for only in their
union can they best serve man. All the nobler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
culture has its responsibility in service. &ldquo;Many
a man has a blind notion of stewardship about
his property, but very few have it about their
knowledge,&rdquo; said Bishop Phillips Brooks, and
he added: &ldquo;One grows tired of seeing cultivated
people with all their culture cursed by
selfishness.&rdquo; To the true idealist&mdash;as distinct
from the mere emotionalist with √¶sthetic tastes&mdash;selfishness
is an impossible prison. The only
spiritual freedom lies in the perpetual sharing
of the fuller life. The gift shared is the gift
doubled. Art is the spiritual glory of life; the
supreme manifestation, the very influence of
spiritual achievement. Mr. Stillman, discussing
the revival of art, has questioned: &ldquo;Does
the world want art any longer? Has it,
in the present state of human progress, any
place which will justify devotion to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He questions as to whether man is still</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Apparelled in celestial light,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">or whether he has lost &ldquo;the glory and the freshness&rdquo;
of his dreams.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;No one can admit,&rdquo; continues Mr. Stillman,
&ldquo;that the human intellect is weaker than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it was five or twenty centuries ago; but it is
certain that if we take the pains to study what
was done five centuries ago in painting, or
twenty centuries ago in sculpture, and compare
it with the best work of to-day, we shall
find the latter trivial and &rsquo;prentice work compared
with the ordinary work of men whose
names are lost in the lustre of a school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, little men inspired by the Zeitgeist,
painted greatly; now, our great men fail to
reach the technical achievement of the little
men of them. There is only one living painter
who can treat a portrait as a Venetian artist
of 1550 A.D. would have done it, and how
differently in the mastery of his material! If
we go to the work of wider range, the Campo
Santo of Pisa, the Stanze, the Sistine Chapel,
the distance becomes an abyss; the simplest
fragment of a Greek statue of 450 B.C. shows
us that the best sculpture of this century, even
the French, is only a happy child-work, not
even to be put in sight of Donatello or Michael
Angelo. The reason is simple, and already
indicated. The early men grew up in a system
in which the power of expression was taught
from childhood; they acquired method as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
musician does now, and the tendency of the
opinion of their time was to keep them in the
good method.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Is this not too narrow and sweeping a judgment?
The art of portraiture certainly did not
die with the Venetian painters of 1550, however
great their work; and if there be but &ldquo;one
living painter&rdquo; who can treat portrait art like
the early Venetians, there are scores of artists
who achieve signal success by other methods of
treatment.</p>

<p>At all events, these three men, Canova, Thorwaldsen,
and Gibson, worked with the conviction
that art is service. With Victor Hugo,
Canova could have said: &ldquo;Genius is not made
for genius; it is made for men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let him
have wings for the infinite provided he has feet
for the earth, and that, after having been seen
flying, he is seen walking. After he has been
seen an archangel, let him be still more a
brother.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To be the servant of God in
the march of progress&mdash;such is the law which
regulates the growth of genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They worked and taught by this creed.
Thorwaldsen, on first arriving in Rome, wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
for three years, it is said, among the
statues of gods and heroes, like a man in a
dream. The atmosphere of the earlier day
when Titian was employed by the king of Portugal
and Raphael by the Pope to create works
of great public importance still lingered and
exerted over Thorwaldsen, and over all artists
susceptible to its subtle influence, a peculiar
spell. Its power was revealed in his subsequent
works&mdash;the &ldquo;Christ;&rdquo; the sculptured
groups for tombs in St. Peter&rsquo;s and in other
churches; the poetic reliefs symbolizing &ldquo;Day&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Night;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ganymede Watering the
Eagle;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Three Graces,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hebe,&rdquo; and
many others.</p>

</div>

<p>Among Canova&rsquo;s works his immortal masterpiece
is the monumental memorial group for
the tomb of Pope Clement XIII in St. Peter&rsquo;s.
The Pope is represented as kneeling in prayer.
The modelling of the entire figure is instinct
with expression. The fine and beautiful hands
express reverence and trust. The countenance
is pervaded with that peace only known to the
soul that is in complete harmony with the
divine power. The Holy Father has taken the
tiara from his head and it lies before him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the cushion on which he kneels. Although the
entire portrayal of the figure reveals that devotion
expressed in the solemn and searching words
of the church service, &ldquo;And here we offer and
present unto thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls
and bodies to be a reasonable, holy, and living sacrifice
unto thee,&rdquo;&mdash;although it is the very utmost
rendering of the soul to God, it is yet the deliberate,
the joyful, the living acceptance of divine
love and no mere trance of ecstasy. No more
wonderful figure in all the range of sculpture
has been created than the Clement XIII of
Canova.</p>

</div>

<p>The group is completed by two symbolic
figures representing Religion and Death. The
former is personified as a female figure holding
a cross; the latter sits with his torch reversed.
Grief, but not hopeless and despairing sorrow, is
portrayed; it is the grief companioned by faith
which ever sees</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The stars shine through the cypress trees.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The base of the monument represents a
chapel guarded by lions. Pistolesi, the great
Italian authority on the sculpture of St. Peter&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and the Vatican galleries, notes that the lions
typify the firmness and the force and the courage,
&ldquo;<i>la fortezza dell&rsquo;anima</i>,&rdquo; that so signally
characterized Clement XIII. There is probably
no sacred monument in the realm of all
modern art which can equal this creation in its
delicacy, its lofty beauty, and the noble message
that it conveys.</p>

<p>The oldest art school, the Accad√©mia di
San Luca, founded in 1507 by Sixtus, when
he called to Rome all the leading artists of
Europe to assist in the decoration of the Sistine
Chapel, is an organization that magically links
the present with the days of Canova, Thorwaldsen,
and Gibson, as it linked them, also, with
the remote and historic past. The father of
the present custodian of the Academy knew
Thorwaldsen well. The grandfather of the
gifted Italian sculptor, Tadolini (who has recently
completed the tomb for Pope Leo XIII,
placed in the Basilica of San Giovanni Laterano),
modelled the bust of Thorwaldsen, and in
one gallery hangs the great Danish sculptor&rsquo;s portrait,
painted by himself. The first director of
San Luca was Federigo Zuccaro. In the early
years of the nineteenth century this Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was a vital centre of art life, and it is still a
school that draws students, although the visitor
who does not loiter and linger in his Rome
may fail to know of this most alluring place.
The San Luca is in the Via Bonella, one of the
old, dark, narrow, and gloomy streets of the
oldest part of Rome,&mdash;a short street of hardly
more than two blocks, running between the
Via Alessandra and the Forum. Hawthorne
vividly pictures all this old Rome when he
speaks of the &ldquo;narrow, crooked, intricate
streets, so uncomfortably paved with little
squares of lava that to tread over them is a
penitential pilgrimage; so indescribably ugly,
moreover; so cold, so alley-like, into which the
sun never falls and where a chill wind forces
its deadly breath into our lungs; the immense
seven-storied, yellow-washed hovels, or call
them palaces, where all that is dreary in domestic
life seems magnified and multiplied; those
staircases which ascend from a ground floor of
cook shops and cobblers&rsquo; stalls, stables and
regiments of cavalry, to a middle region of
princes, cardinals, and ambassadors, and an
upper tier of artists just beneath the unattainable
sky: .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in which the visitor becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sick at heart of Italian trickery, which has uprooted
whatever faith in man&rsquo;s integrity had
till then endured;&rdquo; the city &ldquo;crushed down in
spirit by the desolation of her ruin and the
hopelessness of her future;&rdquo; one recalls these
words when passing through the unspeakable
gloom and horror and desolation and squalor
of ancient Rome. In these surroundings one&rsquo;s
cab stops at &ldquo;No. 44,&rdquo; and ringing the bell the
door is open, whether by super-normal agency
or by some invisible terrestrial manipulation
one is unable to determine; but in the semi-darkness
of the narrow hall he discerns before
him a flight of steep stairs, and, as no other
vista opens, he reasons that, by the law of
exclusion, this must be the appointed way.
Along the wall are seen, here and there, some
antique casts from Trajan&rsquo;s Column, and reliefs
from Canova and Thorwaldsen. The galleries
above hold only a small and a comparatively
unimportant collection of pictures. There
are marines from Vernet and Claude Lorraine;
a &ldquo;Venus Crowned by the Graces&rdquo; from Rubens;
Giulio Romano&rsquo;s copy of Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Galatea,&rdquo;&mdash;the
original of which (in the Villa Farnesina)
represents Galatea surrounded by Nymphs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Cupids, and Tritons, being carried in a shell
across the sea. There is a Cupid, and also the
&ldquo;Fortuna&rdquo; of Guido Reni,&mdash;the latter a figure
of ineffable grace floating in the air. One of
Raphael&rsquo;s early works representing &ldquo;St. Luke
Painting the Madonna&rdquo; is here. There are
several works by Titian, but these have less than
would be expected of the glory usually associated
with his name; and a Vandyke representing
the Virgin and Child, with two angels playing,

</div>

<p>One salon filled with portraits of artists is
especially interesting, and that of Thorwaldsen
is so feminine in its costume and the parting
of the hair, that it is almost inevitably mistaken
for that of a woman. Guido&rsquo;s graceful
&ldquo;Fortuna&rdquo; is represented as a female figure
flying through the air, her long hair streaming
in the wind, and the picture recalls to one the
Greek legend of Opportunity, as told by Kainos.
The legend runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of what town is thy sculptor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of Lukzon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lysippos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And thine?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Opportunity, controller of all things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why standest thou on tiptoe?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am always running.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, then, hast thou wings on both feet?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I fly like the wind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But wherefore bearest thou a razor in thy
right hand?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As a sign to men that I am sharper than
any steel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And why wearest thou thy hair long in
front?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That I may be seized by him who approaches
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Zeus! And thou art bald behind?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because once I have passed with my
winged feet no one may seize me then.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>From one landing, on the steep narrow staircase
of San Luca, opens the Biblioteca Sarti,
an art library of some fifteen thousand volumes.
The sculpture gallery is now closed and can
only be entered by special permission. This
is the more to be regretted as it contains the
principal collections in Rome of the original
casts of the works of Thorwaldsen and Canova.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter-day artists who have been setting
up their Lares and Penates in Rome at various
periods during the early and into the later
years of the nineteenth century have found the
Eternal City in strong contrast with its twentieth-century
aspects, however it may have differed
from the Rome of the Popes. The earlier American
artists to seek the Seven-hilled City were
painters; and Allston, Copley, and Stuart had
already distinguished themselves in pictorial art
before America had produced any sculptor who
could read his title clear to fame. It is to
Hiram Powers (born in Vermont in 1805) that
America must look as her first sculptor,
chronologically considered, closely followed by
Thomas Crawford, who was but eight years his
junior, and by Horatio Greenough, who was
also born in the same year as Powers, and who
preceded him in Italy, but whose work has less
artistic value. Mr. Greenough has left a colossal
(if not an artistic) monument to his gifts in
stately shaft marking Bunker Hill which he
designed. Problematic in their claim to artistic
excellence as are his &ldquo;Washington&rdquo;&mdash;a
seated figure in the grounds of the Capitol in
Washington&mdash;and his group in relief called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Rescue&rdquo; in the portico of the Capitol,
his name lives by his personality as a man of
liberal culture and noble character, if not by
his actual rank in art. First of the American
group in Italy, he was followed by Powers, who
sought the ineffable beauty and enchantment
of Florence in 1837. Horatio Greenough died
in comparatively early life, leaving perhaps the
most interesting of his works in a relief (purchased
by Professor George Ticknor, the distinguished
historian of Spain) &ldquo;representing in
touching beauty and expression a sculptor
in an attitude of dejection and discouragement
before his work, while a hand from above
pours oil into his dying lamp, an allegory
illustrative of the struggles of genius and
the relief which timely patronage may extend
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Powers passed his entire life in Florence.
His work attracted great attention and inspired
ardent appreciation. In portrait busts Powers
was especially successful; and his &ldquo;Greek Slave,&rdquo;
his &ldquo;Fisher Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Il Penseroso,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Proserpine&rdquo;
impressed the art-loving public of the
time as marked by strong artistic power and as
entitled to permanent rank in sculpture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Crawford died young; but his name lives
in the majestic bronze statue of &ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo;
which is in the beautiful white and gold interior
of Symphony Hall, in Boston; and his
&ldquo;Orpheus&rdquo; and some other works claim high
appreciation. Writing of Crawford, Mr. Hillard
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Crawford&rsquo;s career was distinguished by
energy, resolution, and self-reliance. While yet
a youth, he formed the determination to make
himself an artist; and with this view went to
Rome&mdash;alone, unfriended, and unknown&mdash;and
there began a life of toil and renunciation;
resisting the approaches alike of indolence and
despondency. His strength of character and
force of will would have earned distinction for
powers inferior to his. Nothing was given to
self-indulgence; nothing to vague dreams;
nothing to unmanly despair. He did not wait
for the work that he would have, but labored
cheerfully upon that which he could have.
Success came gradually, but surely; and his
powers as surely proved themselves to be
more than equal to the demand made upon
them.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Crawford, Thomas William
Parsons wrote a memorial poem in which
this stanza occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O Rome! what memories awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When Crawford&rsquo;s name is said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of days and friends for whose dear sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That path of Hades unto me<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will have no more of dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than his own Orpheus felt, seeking Eurydice!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O Crawford! husband, father, brother<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are in that name, that little word!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me no more my sorrow smother;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Grief stirs me, and I must be stirred.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thomas Ball, who went in early manhood to
Florence, where he remained until when nearly
at the age of fourscore he returned to his native
land, still continues, at the age of eighty-five, to
pursue the art he loves. He has created works,
as his equestrian statue of &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; in the
Public Gardens and his &ldquo;Lincoln Freeing the
Slave&rdquo; in Park Square, both in Boston; his
great Washington Memorial group in Methuen,
Massachusetts; his &ldquo;Christ Blessing Little Children,&rdquo;
and many other historic and ideal sculptures,
that seem endowed with his beautiful
and winning spirit as well as with his rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
gifts. Larkin G. Mead chose Florence rather
than Rome for his home and work. His noble
&ldquo;River God,&rdquo; placed at the head of the Mississippi
near St. Paul, as well as other interesting
creations, link his name with that of his native
land. Randolph Rogers, a man of genius;
Rinehart, Paul Akers, and Thompson all died
before the full maturity of their powers; Akers
at the early age of thirty-six, leaving, as his
bride of a year, the poet, Elizabeth Akers Allen,
who, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Florence Percy,&rdquo;
has endeared herself to all lovers of lyric art. In
a monograph on Paul Akers, written after his
death, the writer says of his studio in Rome:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Linked with this studio is Hawthorne&rsquo;s tale
of &lsquo;The Marble Faun,&rsquo; as Kenyon&rsquo;s studio was
none other than Paul Akers&rsquo;s. Though Hawthorne
in his romance saw fit to lay the scene
in the rooms once occupied by Canova, it was
in the Via del Crecie that he wove the thread
of his Italian romance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul Akers&rsquo;s growing reputation and increase
of work ere long made it necessary for
him to seek a more commodious studio, and he
took rooms once occupied by the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Canova. Here he had made under his supervision
copies in marble of many of the famous
works of the Vatican and the Capitol. The
largest collection of these was a commission
from Mr. Edward King of Newport, and among
them were busts of Ariadne, Demosthenes, and
Cicero, and a facsimile of the &lsquo;Dying Gladiator&rsquo;
which Mr. King presented to the Redwood
Library of Newport.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3em; margin-right: -3em;">*****</p>

<p>&ldquo;During his first winter in Rome he was
permitted by the authorities to make a cast of
a mutilated bust of Cicero which had long lain
in the Vatican. A critic writing from Rome
in 1857 says of this bust of Cicero: &lsquo;Mr. Akers
obtained permission to take a cast from it; he
then restored the eye, brow, and ears, and
modelled a neck and bust for it in accordance
with the temperament shown by the nervous
and rather thin face. He has succeeded
admirably. It is the very head of the Vatican,
yet without the scars of envious time, and sits
gracefully on human shoulders, instead of being
rolled awkwardly back upon a shelf.&rsquo; This
bust is unlike the portrait which so long passed
for Cicero&rsquo;s, but has been identified by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of a medal which was struck by the Magnesians
in honor of the great orator during his consulate,
and is now the authorized portrait of Cicero.
The finest of Paul Akers&rsquo;s creations executed
during <a name="tn55" id="tn55"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'hs'">his</ins> stay in Rome are &lsquo;St. Elizabeth of
Hungary,&rsquo; which represents the princess at the
moment the roses have fallen to the ground;
&lsquo;Una and the Lion,&rsquo; an illustration of the line in
Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faerie Queene,&rsquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Still while she slept he kept both watch and ward;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">the head of Milton and the &lsquo;Pearl Diver.&rsquo; The
&lsquo;Pearl Diver,&rsquo; now owned by the city of Portland,
represents a youth stretched upon a sea-worn
rock and wrapped in eternal sleep. The
arms are thrown above the head, and about the
waist is a net containing pearl-bearing shells for
which he has risked his life. There is no trace
of suffering; all is subdued to beauty. It is
death represented as the ancients conceived it,
the act of the torch-reverting god. This youth,
who has lost his life at the moment when all
that for which he had dared was within his
grasp, suggests Paul Akers&rsquo;s own untimely
death on the eve of his triumph.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>It was from his Roman studio that Mr. Akers
wrote to a friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Yesterday Browning called. He looked a
long time at my Milton, and said it was Milton,
the man-angel. He praised the wealth of hair
which I had given the head, and then said that
Mrs. Browning had a lock of Milton&rsquo;s hair, the
only one now in existence. This was given her
by Leigh Hunt, just before his death, who
had the records proving it to be genuine. The
hair was, he said, like mine. He invited me
to visit him in Florence, where he would show
me the first edition of Milton&rsquo;s poems, marked
to indicate the peculiar accent which the poet
sometimes adopted, a knowledge of which
makes clear somewhat that otherwise seems
discordant. Milton was so great a musician
that there could have been no fault in sound
in his compositions. He looked over my books;
said my edition of Shelley was one which he
had corrected for the press, not from a knowledge
of the original MS., but from his internal
evidence that so it must have been; said Poe
was a wonderful man; spoke of Tennyson in
the warmest terms. Took up a copy of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
own poems published in the United States, and
remarked that it was better than the English
edition, yet had some awful blunders, and
wished me to allow him to correct a copy for
me. My head of the &lsquo;Drowned Girl&rsquo; caught his
eye and interested him. I told him that I had
thought of Hood&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bridge of Sighs.&rsquo; He then
said that Hood wrote that on his deathbed,
and read it to him before any one else had seen
it. Hood was doubtful whether it was worth
publishing. To-morrow Mrs. Browning is to
come; she has been quite ill since she came to
Rome, and I have seen her but once. I derive
much comfort from the friendship of Charlotte
Cushman. She has just gone from here. She
has frequent breakfast parties; I have attended
but one. Mr. and Mrs. James T. Fields, Wild,
the painter, and myself were the guests. Fields
I like much.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The first works of Mr. Akers were two
portrait busts, of Longfellow and of Samuel
Appleton. Of his bust of Milton, Hawthorne
in the &ldquo;Marble Faun&rdquo; has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In another style, there was the grand, calm
head of Milton, not copied from any one bust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
or picture, yet more authentic than any of
them, because all known representations of the
poet had been profoundly studied and solved
in the artist&rsquo;s mind. The bust over the tomb
in Greyfriar&rsquo;s Church, the original miniatures
and pictures wherever to be found, had mingled
each its special truth in this one work&mdash;wherein
likewise by long perusal and deep love
of &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Comus,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Lycidas,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;L&rsquo;Allegro,&rsquo; the sculptor had succeeded
even better than he knew in spiritualizing his
marble with the poet&rsquo;s mighty genius. And
this was a great thing to have achieved, such a
length of time after the dry bones and dust of
Milton were like those of any other dead man.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Richard Greenough and the painter, Mr.
Haseltine, were prominent figures among the
early American group of the nineteenth-century
artists in Rome. There came Emma Stebbins,
who modelled a fine portrait bust of Charlotte
Cushman; and Anne Whitney, whose statues
of Samuel Adams and of Leif Ericson adorn
public grounds in Boston; whose life-size statue
of Harriet Martineau is the possession of Wellesley
College; and whose &ldquo;Chaldean Astronomer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lotus-Eater,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roma&rdquo;&mdash;a figure personifying
the Rome of Pio Nono&mdash;reveal her
power in ideal creation.</p>

<p>The name of Harriet Hosmer stands out in
brilliant pre-eminence among those of all women
who have followed the plastic art. Her infinite
charm of personality seems to impart itself to
her work, and she has the gift to make friends
as well as to call forms out of clay&mdash;the
success of friendship being one even more permanently
satisfying. In her early life as a
girl hardly more than twenty, she sought Rome,
living with art as her chaperon. Her versatility,
her picturesque individuality, and her
imaginative power all combined to win sympathetic
recognition. Gibson, whose guidance
was particularly well adapted to develop her
gifts, received her into his own studio and took
a deep interest in her work. It was during the
period of her early efforts that Hawthorne was
in Rome, and she is graphically depicted in his
notebooks in her boyish cap at work in the
clay. Gibson was an artist, <i>con amore</i>, and
Miss Hosmer&rsquo;s joyous abandon to her art captivated
his sympathy. &ldquo;In my art what do I
find?&rdquo; he questioned; &ldquo;happiness; love which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
does not depress me; difficulties which I do
not fear; resolution which never abates; flights
which carry me above the ground; ambition
which tramples no one down.&rdquo; Master and
pupil were akin in their unwearied devotion to
art. Of Gibson, whose absence of mind regarding
all the details of life made him almost
helpless in travel and affairs, Miss Hosmer
used gleefully to say that he &ldquo;was a god in
his studio, but God help him out of it!&rdquo; This
glancing sprite of a girl, frightening her friends
by her daring and venturous horseback riding;
gravitating by instinct to offer some generous,
tender aid to the sick, the destitute, or the helpless;
the life and light of gay dinners and of
social evenings; working from six in the morning
till night in her studio, &ldquo;with an absence of
pretension,&rdquo; says Mrs. Browning, &ldquo;and simplicity
of manners which accord rather with
the childish dimples in her rosy cheeks than
with her broad forehead and high aims,&rdquo; had
the magic gift that merged her visitors and
patrons into enthusiastic friends; and Mrs.
Browning has chronicled the pretty scene when
Lady Marion Alford, the daughter of the Earl
of Northumberland, knelt before the girl artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and slipped on her finger a ring&mdash;a precious
ruby set with diamonds&mdash;as a token of her
devotion. Reading Miss Hosmer&rsquo;s life still
further backward, the reader is transported, as
if on some magic carpet, to St. Louis, in the
United States, where a noble and lofty man,
Hon. Wayman Crow,&mdash;a generous friend, a
liberal patron of the arts, a man of the most
refined tastes and culture, whose great qualities
were always used in high service,&mdash;first aided
Miss Hosmer to the preliminary studies in her
art, and whose accomplished and lovely daughters
(now Mrs. Lucien Carr of Boston, Mrs.
Edwin Cushman of Newport and Rome, and
Mrs. Emmons of Leamington, England) were
as a trio of sisters to the young artist. And
&ldquo;the flowing conditions of life&rdquo; bear on this
lifelong friendship until a fair young girl,
√âlise (the daughter of Mrs. Emmons), catches
up this sweet tie and as an accomplished and
lovely young woman in Roman society, when
these &ldquo;flowing conditions&rdquo; had come down even
into the season of 1906-7, Miss Emmons cherished
the fame of Harriet Hosmer and enjoyed
the privilege of a constant correspondence with
the distinguished artist. So the past links itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
again with the present; and who can tell where
any story in life begins or ends in the constant
evolutionary progress?</p>

<p>Miss Hosmer&rsquo;s work attracted wide attention.
Her majestic statue of &ldquo;Zenobia;&rdquo; the winsome
&ldquo;Puck;&rdquo; the impressive statue of &ldquo;Beatrice
Cenci,&rdquo; representing her as she lay in her cell
in Castel San Angelo the night before her execution,&mdash;these
and other works of hers are of
an interesting character and will hold their
permanent rank in sculpture.</p>

<p>Were all the muses present at the christening
of William Wetmore Story&mdash;sculptor, musician,
poet and painter, jurist and man of
letters, and the friend whose social relationships
made life a thing of beauty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To winds and waterfalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And autumn&rsquo;s sunlit festivals,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Mr. Story made his first visit to Italy in 1847;
not at that time with any fixed purpose of exchanging
his profession of the law for art. He
loved literature, and his grace and ease in
expression had already manifested his literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
talent; he had an inclination toward modelling&mdash;it
could hardly, at this time, have been called
by a stronger name&mdash;and curiously enough
with him the usual conditions were reversed
and he received a commission for a statue of
his father, Judge Story, before he had made
any definite turning toward the art of sculpture.
A young man of versatile gifts and accomplished
scholarship, sculpture was to him one
among the many attractive forms of art rather
than the supreme attraction; and it was the
stimulus of the given work that determined
him as a sculptor, rather than his determination
to be a sculptor that determined the work.
Among the goddesses of life Destiny must, perhaps,
be allowed a place. At all events, after
Mr. Story&rsquo;s initial glance at Italy, he sought
Rome again a year later, and this time it was
his choice for life, however unrevealed to his eye
were the resplendent years that lay before him.
He had fallen under the spell of the Magic
Land. In a letter to Lowell, Mr. Story had
questioned how he should ever endure again
&ldquo;the restraint and bondage of Boston.&rdquo; It
was the picturesque Rome of the Popes that he
first knew. The years of 1848-49 were those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of revolutionary activities in Italy. Pio Nono,
one of the most saintly and beloved of the
Popes,&mdash;whose mortal form now rests in that
richly decorated chapel in old San Lorenzo,
<i>fuori le mura</i>, on the site of the church that
Constantine founded on the burial place of St.
Lawrence,&mdash;made his flight to Gaeta and the
Roman republic was established. It was a
dramatic scene when Pio Nono returned (April
12, 1850), entering Rome by the Porta San Giovanni.
The scene from this gate was then, as
now, one of the most impressive in the Eternal
City.</p>

<p>It was in this vast Basilica of San Giovanni
Laterano that Pio Nono entered that April day,
leaving his carriage and walking alone to the
altar, where he knelt in devotion. A splendid
procession awaited without to accompany the
Holy Father to the Papal Palace. The superb
state carriages conveyed princes and foreign
ambassadors and great nobles. From the
Piazza San Giovanni to St. Peter&rsquo;s every house
was illuminated, and the populace cheered and
waved until the very air vibrated with sound
and color. These were the days when the
methods of government were a visible spectacle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a drama, making the life in Rome a daily illuminated
missal.</p>

<p>The Storys, on their return to Italy, located
themselves for a time in Florence, where they
met the Brownings, and that lifelong friendship
between the poet and the sculptor was initiated.
In these happy Florentine days Mr. Story
worked in his studio while his wife read to him
the life of Keats, then just issued, written by
Monckton Milnes, later Lord Houghton. But
the &ldquo;flowing conditions&rdquo; soon bore them onward
to Rome, where they settled themselves
in the Via Porta Pinciana, and met the Crawfords,
who were domiciled in the Villa Negroni.
In these Roman days, too, appeared Mr. Cropsey,
of poetic landscape fame, and here, too, was
Margaret Fuller. Mazzini was then a leading
figure in the Chamber of Deputies,&mdash;&ldquo;the
prophet not only of modern Italy, but of the
modern world.&rdquo; He found Italy &ldquo;utilitarian and
materialistic, permeated by French ideas, and
weakened by her reliance on French initiative.
He was filled with hope that Italy might not only
achieve her own unity, but might once more
accomplish, as she had in the Rome of the
C√¶sars and the Rome of the Church, the unity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the Western world. &lsquo;On my side I believe,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;that the great problem of the day was
a religious problem, to which all other questions
were but secondary.&rsquo;&rdquo; He was asserting
that &ldquo;we cannot relate ourselves to the Divine,
but through collective humanity. It is not by
isolated duty (which indeed the conditions of
modern life render more and more impossible),
nor by contemplation of mere Power as displayed
in the material world, that we can
develop our nature. It is rather by mingling
with the universal life, and by carrying on the
evolution of the never-ending work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The studios of Mr. Crawford in those days
were in the Piazza delle Terme, near the Baths
of Diocletian. William Page, the painter, was
domiciled on the slope of the Quirinal where
he painted a portrait of Charlotte Cushman
which Mrs. Browning described as &ldquo;a miracle&rdquo;;
one of Mrs. Crawford; the head of Mrs. Story,
which he insisted upon presenting to her husband;
and a magnificent portrait of Browning
which the artist presented to Mrs. Browning.
&ldquo;Both of us,&rdquo; wrote Robert Browning of this
gift, &ldquo;would have fain escaped being the subjects
of such princely generosity; but there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
withstanding his delicacy and noble-mindedness.&rdquo;
Mrs. Jameson was much in Rome in
the early years of the 1850-60 decade, living
in the old port by the Tiber nearly opposite
to the new and splendid building of the law
courts. Near the Tarpeian Rock Frederika
Bremer had perched, in a tiny room of which
she took all the frugal care, even to washing
the blue cups and plates when she invited
the Hawthornes to a tea of a simplicity that
suggested, indeed, the utmost degree of &ldquo;light&rdquo;
housekeeping. Thomas Buchanan Read was
one of the hosts and guests of this social
group, and it was at a dinner he gave that
Hawthorne met Gibson, whose conversational
talents were evidently (upon that occasion)
chiefly employed in contemning the pre-Raphaelite
school of painters and emphasizing the need
of sculptors to discover and to follow the principles
of the Greeks,&mdash;&ldquo;a fair doctrine, but
one which Mr. Gibson fails to practise,&rdquo;
observes Hawthorne. The Brownings were
variously bestowed in Rome through succeeding
winters,&mdash;in the <a name="tn205" id="tn205"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Boca'">Bocca</ins> di Leone, in the
Via del Tritone and elsewhere. Mrs. Browning,
as her &ldquo;Casa Guida Windows&rdquo; and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
poems attest, took always the deepest interest
in Italian politics. American and English
friends come and go, but the little group of
residents and the more permanent sojourners,
as the Hawthornes and the Brownings, continue
their daily variations on life in the social
dinners and teas, the excursions and the sight-seeing
of the wonderful city.</p>

<p>Only the magician could &ldquo;call up the vanished
past again&rdquo; and summon into an undeniable
materialization those charming figures to
come forth out of the shadowy air of the rich,
historic past, and stand before us in the full
light of contemporary attention. Not alone this
group of choice persons, but the environment
of their time, the very atmosphere, are demanded
of this necromancy. The figure of
Adelaide Kemble (Mrs. Sartoris) is one of
these, and the tradition still survives of a
concert given in the splendid, spacious hall
of the Palazzo Colonna where she was the prima
donna of the occasion. There were also musicals
at the house of Mrs. Sartoris, where the
guests met her famous sister, Fanny Kemble.
Mrs. Browning was fond of both the sisters,
and said of them that their social brilliancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was their least distinction. She found them
both &ldquo;noble and sympathetic,&rdquo; and her &ldquo;dear
Mr. Page&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hatty&rdquo; (Miss Hosmer) &ldquo;an
immense favorite with us both,&rdquo; she said of
her husband and herself; these and the Storys
made up the special circle for the Brownings in
Rome. &ldquo;The Sartoris house has the best society
in Rome,&rdquo; writes Mrs. Browning to Miss
Mitford, &ldquo;and exquisite music, of course. We
met Lockhart there and my husband sees a
good deal of him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A little society,&rdquo; she
says, &ldquo;is good for soul and body, and on the
Continent it is easy to get a handful of society
without paying too dear for it. This is an
advantage of Continental life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Browning greatly admired the work of
Mr. Page, whose portraits she found &ldquo;like
Titian&rsquo;s.&rdquo; But the tinted statues of Gibson
seemed to her inartistic. His famous painted
Venus she called &ldquo;pretty,&rdquo; but only as a wax
doll might be, not as a work of genuine art.
Then Thackeray and his two daughters came;
Miss Anne (now known to the world of literature
as Anne Thackeray Ritchie) was a special
favorite with Mrs. Browning.</p>

<p>Coming to Rome at one time from Florence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in midwinter, the Brownings found that the
Storys had taken an apartment for them (in
the Via Bocca di Leone), and they arrived to
find lighted fires and lamps. Their journey
had included a week&rsquo;s visit at Assisi, studying
the rich art of Cimabue and Giotto in the
church of the great Franciscan monastery.
Mrs. Browning visited studios in Rome and
found that of Mr. Crawford more interesting
to her than Mr. Gibson&rsquo;s, but no artist is &ldquo;as
near&rdquo; to her, as she herself says, as Mr. Page.
The Storys left the Porta Pinciana to live at
No. 93 in the Piazza di Spagna, and in the
same house with the Brownings, in the Bocca
di Leone, Mr. Page had his apartment. To
Lowell, Mr. Story wrote of the Brownings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Brownings and we became great
friends in Florence, and, of course, we could
not become friends without liking each other.
He, Emelyn says, is like you. He is of my
size, but slighter, with straight black hair,
small eyes, a smooth face, and manner nervous
and rapid. He has great vivacity, but
not the least humor; some sarcasm, considerable
critical faculty, and very great frankness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and friendliness of manner and mind. Mrs.
Browning will sit buried up in a large easy-chair
listening and talking very quietly and
pleasantly. Very unaffected is she.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have hundreds of statues in my head, but they
are in the future tense. Powers I knew very
well in Florence. He is a man of great mechanical
talent and natural strength of perception,
but with no poetry in his composition,
and I think no creative power.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have
been to hear Allegri&rsquo;s &lsquo;Miserere&rsquo; in the Sistine
Chapel, with the awful and mighty figures of
Michael Angelo looking down from the ceiling; to
hear Guglielmi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Miserere&rsquo; in St. Peter&rsquo;s, while
the gloom of evening was gathering in the lofty
aisles and shrouding the frescoed domes, was
a deeply affecting and solemnly beautiful experience.
Never can one forget the plaintive
wailing of the voices that seemed to implore
pity and pardon.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was in 1856 that the Storys located
themselves in Palazzo Barberini, which Bernini
designed and which was built &ldquo;out of the
quarry of the Coliseum&rdquo; by Urban VIII. It
is one of the wonderful old palaces of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&mdash;this
mass of Barberini courts, gardens, terraces,
and vast apartments, with the interminable
winding stairs, where on one landing Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s
lion lies before the great doors decorated
with the arms of Popes and princes.
Here the old Cardinal Barberini lived his
stormy life; here are the gallery and the library,&mdash;the
latter stored with infinite treasures of ancient
documents, old maps whose portrayal of the
earth bears little resemblance to the present,
and famous manuscripts and volumes in old vellum,
some fifty thousand in all. In the Barberini
gallery are a few noted works,&mdash;Raphael&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Fornarina,&rdquo; Guido&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beatrice Cenci,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Holy Family&rdquo; by Andrea del Sarto, and others.</p>

</div>

<p>The Via delle <a name="tn72" id="tn72"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Quatre'">Quattro</ins> Fontane, on which the
Palazzo Barberini stands, might well be known
as the street of the wonderful vista. One strolls
down it to the Via Sistina and to Piazza Trinit√†
de&rsquo; Monti at the head of the Spanish steps
(the Scala di Spagna), pausing for the loveliness
of the view. Across the city rises the
opposite height of Monte Mario, and to the
left the Janiculum, now crowned with the magnificent
equestrian statue of Garibaldi, which
is in evidence from almost every part of Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
As far as the eye can see the Campagna stretches
away, infinite as the sea&mdash;a very Campagna
Mystica. The luminous air, the faint, misty
blue of the distance, the deep purple shadows
on the hills, make up a landscape of color. At
the foot of the Spanish steps the flower venders
spread out their wares,&mdash;great bunches of the
flame-colored roses peculiar to Italy, the fragrant
white hyacinths, golden jonquils, baskets
of violets, and masses of lilies of the valley.</p>

<p>On many a night of brilliant moonlit glory
the artistic sojourners in Rome lingered on the
parapet of the Pincian Hill watching the moonlight
flood the Eternal City until churches and
palaces seemed to swim in a sea of silver. Or
in the morning, when the rose-red of dawn
was aglow, there seemed to hover over the
city that wraith of mist whose secret Claude
Lorraine surprises in his landscapes. These
dawn visions of mysterious, incredible beauty
are a part of the very identity of Rome.</p>

<p>There were mornings when the Hawthornes
with Mrs. Jameson or some other friend would
drive out to the old San Lorenzo (<i>fuori le mura</i>),
the church founded by Constantine in 330 on
the site where the body of St. Lawrence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
buried. At various periods the church was
enlarged and finally, as recently as in 1864,
Pio Nono had great improvements made under
the architect Vespignani. In the piazza in front
was placed an immense column of red granite,
some sixty feet high, with the statue of St.
Lawrence, a standing figure, at the top. It is
most impressive. The colonnade at the entrance
of the church is decorated with frescoes
and contains two immense sarcophagi, whose
sides are beautifully sculptured with reliefs.
The roof is supported by six Ionic columns.
Entering the church one finds an interior of
three aisles divided by colossal columns of
Oriental granite. In the middle aisle, on both
sides the galleries, are fresco paintings illustrating
the martyrdom of St. Lawrence and of St.
Stephen, one series on the right and the other
on the left. One of these paintings, especially,
of the life of St. Lawrence, is strangely haunting
to the imagination. It represents the youthful,
slender figure, nude, save for slight drapery,
laid on the gridiron while the fire is being
kindled under it and the fagots shovelled in.
The physical shrinking of the flesh&mdash;of every
nerve&mdash;from the torture, the spiritual strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and invincible energy of the countenance, are
wonderfully depicted. The great aisle was
painted by order of Pius IX by Cesare Fracassini;
in it are two pulpits of marble. A double
staircase of marble conducts to that part of the
Basilica of Constantine which by Honorius III
was converted into the presbytery. It is decorated
at the upper end by twelve columns of
violet marble which rise from the level of the
primitive basilica beneath. At the end is the
ancient pontifical seat, adorned with mosaic and
precious marbles. The papal altar is under a
canopy in the Byzantine style. The pavement
of this presbytery is worthy of particular attention.
Descending to the confessional which is
under the high altar the tomb of the martyred
saints, Lawrence, Stephen, and Justin, is found.</p>

</div>

<p>It was the request of Pio Nono that his mortal
body should rest here, where it is placed in a
simple tomb, according to his own instructions;
but the chapel is very rich in decoration which
was paid for by money sent from all parts of
the world.</p>

<p>The chapel walls are entirely encrusted in
mother-of-pearl, gilt bronze, and beautiful
marbles. The mosaic paintings are formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gold and precious stones of fabulous value.
This interior is perhaps the richest in the
world in its decoration. San Lorenzo is a
patriarchal church, and one of the seven pilgrimage
churches of Rome. Near San Lorenzo
is the Campo Verano, a cemetery containing
many beautiful memorial sculptures.</p>

<p>In those days, half a century ago, the entrance
most often used by visitors to Rome was through
the Via Flaminia and the Porta del Popolo,
opening on the Piazza del Popolo, rather the
most picturesque and impressive place in all
Rome. On the left is the Pincian Hill (Monte
Pincio), with its rich terraces, balustrades,
its beautiful porticos filled with statuary,
its groves of cypress and ilex trees; a classic
vision rising on the sight and enchanting the
imagination. On the side opposite the Porta
three roads diverge in fan shape&mdash;the Via
Babuino, the Corso, and the Ripetta, with the
&ldquo;twin churches&rdquo; side by side; one between the
Babuino and the Corso, the other between
the Corso and the Ripetta.</p>

<p>The Corso (which was the ancient Flaminian
Way) runs straight to the Piazza Venezia at the
foot of the Capitoline Hill. This Piazza del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Popolo was widened and decorated by Pius VII.
It is formed by two semicircles, adorned with
fountains and statues, and terminated by four
symmetrical edifices. In the semicircles are
colossal groups in marble, and a road opposite
the Pincio leads to the Ponte Margherita and
the Prati di Castello.</p>

<p>The obelisk in the centre of the piazza was
brought to Rome from Heliopolis by C√¶sar
Augustus and originally stood in the Circus
Maximus. It was erected here by Pope Sixtus
V, and it is nearly a hundred feet in height.
It is formed of red granite, and while it has
been broken in three places, the hieroglyphics
are still legible. This obelisk was first erected
in Egypt as a part of the Temple of the Sun
at Heliopolis, in a period preceding that of
Rameses II. After the battle of Actium, Augustus
transported it to Rome, and it was first
placed in the Circus Maximus, but during the
reign of Valentinian it fell from its pedestal
and lay buried in the earth, until in the sixteenth
century Pope Sixtus V had it placed in
the centre of the Piazza del Popolo, and consecrated
it to the cross. The two inscriptions
are on opposite sides. One thus reads:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Emperor C√¶sar, son of the divine
C√¶sar Augustus, Sovereign Pontiff, twelve times
Emperor, eleven times Consul, fourteen times
Tribune, having conquered Egypt, consecrated
this gift to the Sun.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The other inscription is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Sixtus V, Sovereign Pontiff, excavated,
transported, and restored this obelisk, sacrilegiously
consecrated to the Sun by the great
Augustus, in the great Circus, where it lay in
ruins, and dedicated it to the cross triumphant
in the fourth year of his pontificate.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The Church of Santa Maria del Popolo is
built into the very wall of Monte Pincio on the
site of Nero&rsquo;s tomb. It dates back to 1099,
and consists of three naves and several chapels.
In the first chapel is a &ldquo;Nativity&rdquo; by Pinturicchio,
who also painted the lunettes.
Another chapel belongs to the Cibo family, and
is rich in marbles and adorned with sixteen
columns of Sicilian jasper. The &ldquo;Conception&rdquo;
is by Maratta, the &ldquo;Martyrdom of St. Lawrence&rdquo;
by Morandi, and the &ldquo;St. Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>&rdquo;
by Volterra. The &ldquo;Visitation&rdquo; was sculptured
by Bernini in 1679. The third chapel is painted
by Pinturicchio (1513), and the fourth has an
interesting bas-relief of the fifteenth century.
The picture of the Virgin, on the high altar, is
one of those attributed to St. Luke; the paintings
on the vault of the choir are by Pinturicchio.
The two marble monuments are, from
their perfection of design and execution, reckoned
among the best modern works. They are
by Cantucci da S. Savino. In the chapel following
is an &ldquo;Assumption&rdquo; by Annibale Carracci;
the side pictures are by Caravaggio. The last
chapel but one in the small nave is the Chigi
chapel, and is one of the most celebrated in
Rome.</p>

<p>Raphael gave the designs for the dome, the
paintings of the frieze, and the altar picture.
This latter was begun by Del Piombo and finished
by Salviati. The statue of Daniel is by
Bernini. The front of the altar and the statues
of Jonah and Elijah were done by Lorenzetto
(1541), from designs by Raphael. Outside this
chapel is the monument of Princess Odescalchi
Chigi (1771), by Paolo Posi. The stained windows
of the choir belong to the fourteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and in the sacristy and the vestibule are
monuments also of the fourteenth century and
of the fifteenth. Luther resided in the convent
attached to this church when he was in Rome.</p>

<p>There is a legend that a large walnut tree
grew on the site of Nero&rsquo;s tomb in whose
branches innumerable crows had their home,
and that they devastated all that part of Rome.
An appeal was made to the Virgin, who declared
that the crows were demons who kept
watch over the ashes of Nero, and ordered the
tree to be cut down and burned, the ashes being
scattered to the air, and that, on the spot, a
church should be built to her honor. This was
accomplished, and the crows no more troubled
the Eternal City.</p>

<p>The gardens of Lucullus were on the Monte
Pincio. The view of the terraced hillside from
the Piazza del Popolo is one of the most impressive
in Rome.</p>

<p>The Hawthornes left Rome in 1859; and the
death of Mrs. Browning in June of 1861 left
the little circle of the Roman winters irreparably
broken. &ldquo;Returning to Rome,&rdquo; wrote Story
to Charles Eliot Norton, &ldquo;I have not one single
intimate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no one with whom I can walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
any of the higher ranges of art and philosophy.&rdquo;
Mr. Story had modelled the busts of both Mr.
and Mrs. Browning during their sojourns in
Rome; in 1853 Harriet Hosmer had made the cast
of the &ldquo;clasped hands&rdquo; of the poets, the model
having since been cast in bronze; Mr. Page had,
as already noted, painted a portrait of Robert
Browning; and Mr. Leighton (afterward Sir
Frederick) had made a beautiful portrait sketch
of Mrs. Browning. In later years all these
memorials, with other paintings or plastic
sketches of the wedded poets, were grouped in
Mr. Barrett Browning&rsquo;s palace in Venice.</p>

<p>At this time Mr. Story had completed his
&ldquo;Cleopatra,&rdquo; which Hawthorne had embalmed
in literary mention in &ldquo;The Marble Faun;&rdquo;
and beside his &ldquo;Judith,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sappho,&rdquo; and other
lesser works, he had achieved one of his finest
successes in the &ldquo;Libyan Sibyl.&rdquo; Both the
&ldquo;Cleopatra&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sibyl&rdquo; became famous.
Whether they would produce so strong an effect
at the present stage of twentieth-century life is
a problem, but one that need not press for
solution. Mr. Story was singularly fortunate
in certain conditions that grouped themselves
about his life and combined to establish his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
fame. These conditions, of course, were largely
the outer reflection of inner qualities, as our
conditions are apt to be; still, the &ldquo;lack of
favoring gales&rdquo; not infrequently foredooms some
gallant bark to a disastrous course.</p>

<span class="i0">And the loved one all together.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Story&rsquo;s nature was eminently sympathetic
with the other arts; he was himself almost as
much a literary man as he was a sculptor; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was the friend and companion of literary men,
and to the fact that art in the middle years of
the nineteenth century was far more a literary
topic than a matter of critical scrutiny, Mr.
Story owed an incalculable degree of his fame.
He was an extremely interesting figure with his
social grace, his liberal culture, and his versatile
gifts. His life was centred in choice and
refined associations. If not dowered with lofty
and immortal original genius, he had a singular
combination of talent, of fastidious taste, and of
the intellectual appreciation that enabled him
to select interesting ideal subjects to portray in
the plastic art. These appealed to the special
interest of his literary friends and were widely
discussed in the press and periodicals of the
day. It is a <i>bonmot</i> of contemporary studio life
that Hawthorne rather than Story created the
&ldquo;Cleopatra,&rdquo; and one ingenious spirit suggests
that as Mr. Story put nothing of expression or
significance into his statues, the beholder could
read into them anything he pleased; finding an
empty mould, so to speak, into which to pour
whatever image or embodiment he might conjure
up from the infinite realm of imagination.
One of the latest of these contemporary critics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
declares that &ldquo;Story declined appreciably, year
by year, falling away from his own standard;
haunted to the point of obsession by visions
of mournful female figures, generally seated,
wrapped in gloom. It seems strange,&rdquo; this
critic continues, &ldquo;that so active a mind should
dream of nothing but brooding, sinister souls,
of bodies bowed in grief, or tense with rage.
Never once, apparently, did there come to
him a vision of buoyancy and grace; of a
beauty that one could love; of good cheer
and joy of very living; always these unwholesome
creatures born of that belated Byronic
romanticism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This criticism, while it has as little appreciation
of Mr. Story&rsquo;s exquisite culture and of
the taste and refinement of his art as the general
rush of the motor car and telephonic conversational
life of the first decade of the twentieth
century has of the thoughtful, the poetic,
the leisurely atmosphere of Mr. Story&rsquo;s time,
is yet not without a keen flashlight of truth.
Painting had its reactionary crisis from the
pre-Raphaelite ideals and the <i>intransigeants</i>
have had their own conflicts in which they survived,
or disappeared, according to the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of artistic vitality within. Sculpture and literature
must also meet the series of tests to which
the onward progress of life persists in subjecting
them, and those who are submerged and
perish can only encourage the survivors as did
the Greeks, as sung by Theocritus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A shipwrecked sailor, buried on this coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bids you set sail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a gallant ship, when we were lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Weathered the gale.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;As we refine, our checks grow finer,&rdquo; said
Emerson. As life becomes more elaborate and
ambitious, the critical tests increase. Contemporary
fame can be created for the artist by
favorable contemporary comment; but it rests
with himself, after all; it rests in the abiding
significance of his work&mdash;or the lack of it&mdash;as
to whether this fame is perpetuated. That
of Mr. Story does not hold within itself all the
qualities that insure the appreciation of the
present day. It is, as the critic of the hour
expresses himself, &ldquo;too literary,&rdquo;&mdash;too largely
a question of classic titles which appealed to
the mid-nineteenth-century authors whose judgment
of art the twentieth century finds particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
amusing. Henry James has somewhere
held up to ridicule the early Beacon Hill Boston
for its impassioned devotion to the &ldquo;attenuated
outlines&rdquo; of Flaxman&rsquo;s art. But the
work of Story will survive all transient variations
of opinion, even of the present realistic
age; for is not true realism, after all, to be
found in the eternal ideals of truth, grace,
dignity, refinement, significance, and beauty?
These qualities have a message to convey; and
no one can study with sympathetic appreciation
any sculpture of William Wetmore Story
without feeling that the work has something to
say; that it is not a mere reproduction of some
form, but is, rather, an idea impersonated, and
therefore it has life, it has significance. The
criticism of the immediate hour is not necessarily
infallible because it is contemporary.
What does William Watson say?</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A deft musician does the breeze become<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whenever an √Üolian harp it finds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hornpipe and hurdy-gurdy both are dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unto the most musicianly of winds.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is an irretrievable loss if, in the passion
for the <i>vita nuova</i>, a generation, or a century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
shall substitute for the √Üolian harp the mere
hornpipe and hurdy-gurdy of the hour. In
another of his keenly critical quatrains William
Watson embodies this signal truth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;His rhymes the poet flings at all men&rsquo;s feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And whoso will may trample on his rhymes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should Time let die a song that&rsquo;s pure and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The singer&rsquo;s loss were more than matched by Time&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Art is progressive, and the present is always
the &ldquo;heir of all the ages&rdquo; preceding; but it
cannot be affirmed that it invariably makes the
best use of its rich inheritance.</p>

<p>There are latter-day sculptors who excel in
certain excellences that Story lacked; still, it
would not be his loss, but our own, if we fail
in a due recognition of that in his art which
may appeal to the imagination; for, whatever
the enthusiasms of other cults may be, there are
qualities of beauty, strength, and profound significance
in the art of Story that must insure
their permanent recognition. Still, it remains
true that Mr. Story owes his fame in an incalculable
degree to the friendly pens of Hawthorne
and others of his immediate circle,&mdash;Lowell,
Motley, Charles Eliot Norton, Thackeray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Browning,&mdash;friends who, according to
the latest standards of art criticism, were not
unqualified nor absolute judges of art, but
who were in sympathy with ideal expression
and recognized this as embodied in the statues
of Story.</p>

<p>Browning wrote to the London <i>Times</i> an
article on Mr. Story&rsquo;s work, in which he conjured
up most of the superlative phrases of
commendation that the limits of the English
language allow to praise his work, none of
whose marshalled force was too poor to do him
reverence. The versatile gifts of Story&rsquo;s personality
drew around him friends whose influence
was potent and, indeed, authoritative in
their time.</p>

<p>Still, any analysis of these conditions brings
the searcher back to the primary truth that
without the gifts and grace to attract about him
an eminent circle of choice spirits he could not
have enjoyed this potent aid and inspiration;
and thus, that</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 10em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Man is his own star,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">is an assertion that life, as well as poetry, justifies.
In the full blaze of this fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
truth, it is, not unfrequently, the mysterious
spiritual tragedy of life that many an one as
fine of fibre and with lofty ideals</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Mr. Story was himself of too fine an order
not to divine this truth. With what unrivalled
power and pathos has he expressed it in his
poem&mdash;one far too little known&mdash;the &ldquo;Io
Victis&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this poem Mr. Story touched the highest

</div></div>

<p>Such a poem must have its own immortality
in lyric literature.</p>

<p>For a period of forty years the home of the
Storys in Palazzo Barberini was a noted centre
of the most charming social life. Mr. Story&rsquo;s
literary work&mdash;in his contributions of essays
and poems to the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>; in his published
works, the &ldquo;Roba di Roma,&rdquo; &ldquo;Conversations
in a Studio,&rdquo; his collected &ldquo;Poems,&rdquo;
and others&mdash;gave him a not transitory rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in literature which rivals, if it does not exceed,
his rank in art.</p>

<p>Meantime other artists were to take up their
permanent abode in the Seven-hilled City,&mdash;Elihu
Vedder in 1866; Franklin Simmons two
years later; Waldo and Julian Story, the two
sons of William Wetmore Story, though claiming
Rome as their home, are American by
parentage and ancestry; and Mr. Waldo Story
succeeds his father in pursuing the art of sculpture
in the beautiful studios in the Via San
Martino built by the elder Story. In 1902
Charles Walter Stetson, with his gifted wife,
known to the contemporary literary world by
her maiden name, Grace Ellery Channing, set
up their household gods and lighted their altar
fires in the city by the Tiber, ready, it may be,
to exclaim with Ovid:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 25em;"><div class="stanza">

<p class="caption noi"><small>THE DANCE OF THE PLEIADES<br /> Elihu Vedder</small></p>
</div>

<p>If art is a corner of the universe seen through
a temperament, the temperament of Mr. Vedder
must offer an enthralling study, for it seems to be
a lens whose power of refraction defies prophecy
because it deals with the incalculable forces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
His art concerns itself little with the √¶sthetic,
but is chiefly the art of the intellect and the
imagination. All manner of symbols and analogies;
the laws of the universe that prevail
beyond the stars; the celestial figures; the
undreamed significance in prophecy or in destiny;
omens, signs, and wonders; the world
forces, advancing stealthily in the shadows of
a dusky twilight; the Fates, under brilliant
skies, gathering in the stars; oracles and supernatural
coincidences that lurk in undreamed-of
days; the Pleiades dancing in a light that never
was on sea or land; unknown Shapes that meet
outside space and time and question each
other&rsquo;s identity; the dead that come forth from
their graves and glide, silent and spectral,
through a crowd, unseen by any one; the
prayer of the celestial powers poured forth in
the utter solitude of the vast desert,&mdash;it is these
that are the realm of Vedder&rsquo;s art, and what
has the normal world of portrait and landscape
to do with such art as this? Can it only be
relegated to a class, an order, of its own, and
considered as being&mdash;Vedderesque? It seems
to stand alone and unparalleled. In his work
lies the transfiguration of all mystery. Vedder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
never paints nature, in the sense of landscapes,
and yet one often feels that he has the key to
the very creation of nature; that he has supped
with gods and surprised the secrets of the stars.
Do the winds whisper to him?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Muse can knit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is past, what is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the web that&rsquo;s just begun.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How can he find the design to phrase his
thought&mdash;this painter of ideas?</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Can blaze be done in cochineal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or noon in mazarin?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whatever the Roman environment may have
done for Allston, Page, and Story, there is no
question but that to Vedder it has been as his
soul&rsquo;s native air. For him the sirens sing again
on the coast; the sorceress works her spell; the
Cum√¶an Sibyl again flies, wraithlike, over the
plain, clasping her rejected leaves of destiny
which Tarquin in his blindness has refused to
buy. The Rome that lies buried under the
ages rises for Vedder. His art cannot be catalogued
under any known division of portrait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
landscape, marine, or genre, but it is simply&mdash;the
art of Vedder. It stands alone and absolutely
unrivalled. The pictorial creations of
Vedder are as wholly without precedent or
comparison as if they were the sole pictorial
treasures of the world. The visitor may care
for them, or not care, according to his own
ability to comprehend and to recognize the
inscrutable genius there manifested; but in
either case he will find nowhere else, in either
ancient or contemporary art, any parallel to
these works.</p>

<p>One could well fancy that to any interrogation
of his conceptions the artist might reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I am seeker of the stone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stand not, pause not in my going.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the rich, weird realm of Omar Khayyam&rsquo;s
Persian poem, the Rubaiyat, Mr. Vedder found
the opportunity of his life for translating its
thought into strange, mystic symbolism. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
were artist and poet so blended in one as
in Vedder&rsquo;s wonderful illustrations for this
poem. It has nothing in common with what
we ordinarily call an illustrated work. It is a
great treasure of art for all the ages. It is
a very fount of inspiration for painter and
poet. An exquisite sonnet suggested by &ldquo;The
Angel of the Darker Cup&rdquo; is the following by
Louise Chandler Moulton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;She bends her lovely head to taste thy draught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou stern Angel of the Darker Cup!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thee to-night in the dim shades to sup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all they be who from that cup have quaffed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had been glad in her own loveliness, and laughed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Life&rsquo;s strong enemies who lie in wait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kept with golden youth her queenly state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All unafraid of Sorrow&rsquo;s threat&rsquo;ning shaft.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Then human Grief found out her human heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she was fain to go where pain is dumb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Thou wert welcome, Angel dread to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she fares onward with thee, willingly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell where no man loves, no lovers part,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Grief that is, makes welcome Death to come.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sonnet, the stanza, and the pictorial
interpretation all form one beautiful trio in
poetic and graphic art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Writing of Mr. Vedder, Mr. W. C. Brownell
speaks of the personal force in a picture and
says that with Vedder this personal force is imagination,&mdash;&ldquo;the
imagination of a man whose
natural expression is pictorial, but who is a man
as well as a painter; who has lived as well as
painted, who has speculated, pondered, and felt
much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is this,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;that
places Vedder in the front rank of the imaginative
painters of the day.&rdquo; Of Mr. Vedder&rsquo;s
painting called &ldquo;The Enemy Sowing Tares,&rdquo;
Mr. Brownell writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Here you note a dozen phases of significance.
The theme is unconventional; the
man has become the archenemy; the night is
weird and awe-inspiring; the tares represent
the foe of the church&mdash;money; they are sown
at the foot of the cross&mdash;the symbol of the
church.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr. Vedder has not passed his
life in Rome for nothing. His attitude is in
harmony with the spirit of the Sistine and the
Stanze.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>One of the interesting and mystical works of
Vedder is &ldquo;The Soul between Doubt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Faith,&rdquo;&mdash;three heads, that of the Soul hooded
and draped, looking before her with eyes that
seem to discern things not seen by mortals;
the sinister face of Doubt at the left, the serene,
inspiring countenance of Faith at the right. It
is a magical picture to have before one with its
profoundly significant message. The works of
Mr. Vedder will grow more priceless as the
years pass by. They are pictures for the ages.</p>

<p>In Mr. Ezekiel, another American artist
whose almost lifelong home has been in Rome,
is a sculptor whose touch and technique have
won recognition. In a recumbent figure of
Christ is seen one of the best examples of his
art. It is pervaded by the classic influences in
which he has lived. The studios of Mr. Ezekiel,
in the ruins of the old Baths of Caracalla,
are very picturesque and his salon, with its
music, its wealth of books including many rare
and beautiful copies, and its old pictures and
bric-a-brac, is one of the fascinating interiors of
the Eternal City.</p>

<p>The visitor who is privileged to see the Story
studios in the Via San Martino finds Mr. Waldo
Story occupying these spacious rooms where the
flash of a fountain in the court, a view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
garden, green-walled by vines, with flowers and
shrubs and broken statues, make the place
alluring to dreamer and poet. In these rooms
may be seen many of the elder Story&rsquo;s finest
statues in cast or marble, the &ldquo;Libyan Sibyl,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nemesis,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sappho,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;Into the
Silent Land,&rdquo; and others, with many portrait
busts, among which are those of Browning,
Shelley, Keats, Theodore Parker, Mrs. Browning,
Marchesa Peruzzi de Medici (Edith Story),
John Lothrop Motley, one of Story&rsquo;s nearer
friends, and Lord Houghton.</p>

<p>In the work of Mr. Waldo Story one admirable
portrait bust is of Cecil Rhodes. A decorative
work, a fountain for the Rothschild
country estate in England, is charmingly designed
as a Galatea (in bronze), standing in a
marble shell that is drawn by Nereids and
attended by Cupids. The happy blending of
marble and bronze gives to this work a pleasing
variety of color. Another decorative design
is that of &ldquo;Nymphs Drinking at the Fountain
of Love.&rdquo; These studios are among the most
interesting in Rome.</p>

<p>It was in 1868 that Franklin Simmons, then
a young artist from Maine, turned to Rome as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his artistic Mecca. Since then the Eternal City
has always been his home, but his frequent and
prolonged sojourns in America have kept him
closely in touch with its national life. Mr.
Simmons is the idealist who translates his
vision into the actuality of the hour and who
also exalts this actuality of the hour to the
universality of the vision. In the creation of
portrait busts and of the statues and monumental
memorials of great men he infuses into
them the indefinable quality of extended relation
which relegates his work to the realm of
the universal and, therefore, to the immortality
of art, rather than restricting it to the temporal
locality. Louis Gorse observes that it is not
the absence of faults that constitutes a masterpiece,
but that it is flame, it is life, it is emotion,
it is sincerity. Under the touch of Mr. Simmons
the personal accent speaks; to his creative
power flame and life respond, and to no sculptor
is the truth so admirably stated by M.
Gorse more applicable.</p>

<p>Mr. Simmons has been singularly fortunate
in a wide American recognition, having received
a liberal share of the more important commissions
for great public works of sculpture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
splendid statue, <i>al fresco</i>, of the poet Longfellow
for his native city, Portland, was appropriately
the work of Mr. Simmons as a native of
the same state; the portrait statues of General
Grant, Gov. William King, Roger Williams, and
Francis H. Pierrepont, all in Statuary Hall in
the Capitol in Washington; the portrait busts of
Grant, Sheridan, Porter, Hooker, Thomas, and
other heroes of the Civil War; the colossal
group of the Naval Monument at the head of
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,&mdash;are all
among the works of Mr. Simmons.</p>

<p>Like all artists who, like the poet, are
born and not made, Mr. Simmons gave evidence
of his artistic bent in his early childhood.
After graduating from Bates College he modelled
a bust of its president, and a little
later, going to Washington (in the winter of
1865-66), many of the noted men of the time
gave him sittings, and in a series of portrait
busts his genius impressed itself by its dignity
of conception and an unusual power of sympathetic
interpretation. He modelled the bust of
Grant while he was the General&rsquo;s guest in
camp, taking advantage of whatever spare
minutes General Grant could give for sittings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in the midst of his pressing responsibilities; and
it is perhaps due to this unusually intimate
intercourse with the great hero, and the <i>rapport</i>,
not difficult of establishment, between two men
whose natures were akin in a certain noble sincerity
and lofty devotion to the purest ideals,
that Mr. Simmons owes the power with which
he has absolutely interpreted the essential characteristics
of General Grant in that immortal
portrait statue in the Capitol.</p>

<p>Washington is, indeed, the place to especially
study the earlier work of Franklin Simmons.
An important one is the Logan memorial,&mdash;an
equestrian statue which is considered the finest
work in sculpture in the capital, and which is
the only statue in the United States in which
both the group and the pedestal are of bronze.
The visitor in Washington who should be ignorant
of the relative rank of the great men commemorated
by the equestrian memorial monuments
of the city might be justified in believing
that General Logan was the most important
man of his time, if he judged from the relative
greatness of his statue. When Congress decided
upon this group, Mr. Simmons was
requested to prepare a model. This proving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
eminently acceptable, Mr. Simmons found himself,
quite to his own surprise, fairly launched
on this arduous work, involving years of intense
concentration and labor. For this monumental
work was to be not merely that of the brave
and gallant military leader,&mdash;a single idea
embodied, as in those of Generals Scott, Sheridan,
Thomas, and others,&mdash;but it was to be a permanent
interpretation of the soldier-statesman,
mounted on his battle-horse; it was to be, in
the comprehensive grasp of Mr. Simmons, the
vital representation of the complex life and
individuality of General Logan and, even more,
it must reflect and suggest the complex spirit
of his age. In this martial figure was thus embodied
a manifold and mysterious relation, as
one of the potent leaders and directive powers
in an age of tumultuous activities; an age of
strife and carnage, whose goal was peace; of
adverse conditions and reactions, whose manifest
outcome was yet prosperity and national
greatness and splendid moral triumph. All
these must be suggested in the atmosphere, so
to speak, of the artist&rsquo;s work; and no sculptor
who was not also an American&mdash;not merely
by ancestry and activity, but one in mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
heart only; one who was an intense patriot and
identified with national ideas&mdash;could ever have
produced such a work as that of the Logan
monument. So unrivalled does it stand, unique
among all the equestrian art of this country,
that it enchants the art student and lover with
its indefinable spell. When this colossal work
was cast in bronze, in Rome, the event was
considered important. The king and the
Royal family visited the studio of Mr. Simmons
to see the great group, and so powerfully did
its excellence appeal to King Umberto that he
knighted Mr. Simmons, making him Cavaliere
of the Crown of Italy. Nor was Mr. Simmons
the prophet who was not without honor save in
his own country, for his <i>alma mater</i> gave him
the degree of M.A. in 1867; Colby College
honored him with the Master&rsquo;s degree in 1885,
and in 1888 Bowdoin bestowed upon this eminent
Maine artist the same degree. In 1892
Mr. Simmons married the Baroness von Jeinsen,
a brilliant and beautiful woman who,
though a lady of foreign title, was an American
by birth. An accomplished musician, a critical
lover of art, and the most delightful of hostesses
and friends, Mrs. Simmons drew around her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
remarkable circle of charming people and made
their home in the Palazzo Tamagno a notable
centre of social life. No woman in the American
colony of the Seven-hilled City was ever
more beloved; and it was frequently noted by
guests at her weekly receptions that Mrs. Simmons
was as solicitous for the enjoyment of
the most unknown stranger as for those of
rank and title who frequented her house. Her
grace and loveliness were fully equalled by her
graciousness and that charm of personality
peculiarly her own. Her death in Rome, on
Christmas of 1905, left a vacant place, indeed,
in many a home which had been gladdened by
her radiant presence. One of the most beautiful
works of Mr. Simmons is a portrait of his
wife in bas-relief, representing her standing just
at the opening of parted curtains, as if she
were about to step behind and vanish. It is
a very poetic conception. A bust of Mrs. Simmons,
also, in his studio, is fairly a speaking
likeness of this beautiful and distinguished
woman. It is over her grave in the Protestant
cemetery that Mr. Simmons has placed one of
his noblest ideal statues, &ldquo;The Angel of the
Resurrection,&rdquo;&mdash;a memorial monument that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
one of the art features of Rome to the visitor
in the Eternal City.</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 232px;">

<p class="caption noi"><small>&ldquo;GRIEF AND HISTORY,&rdquo;<br /> DETAIL FROM NAVAL MONUMENT, WASHINGTON<br />

</div>

<p>The brilliant and impressive Naval Monument,
or Monument of Peace, as it is known in
Washington, placed at the foot of Capitol Hill
on Pennsylvania Avenue, is eloquent with the
power of heroic suggestion that Mr. Simmons
has imparted to it. The work breathes that
exaltation of final triumph that follows temporary
defeat. Those who died that the nation
might live, are seen in the perpetual illumination
of immortality. Not only has Mr. Simmons
here perpetuated the suffering, the
sacrifices of the Civil War, but that sublime
and eternal truth of victory after defeat, of
peace and serene exaltation after conflict, and
the triumph of life after death, are all immortally
embodied in this group crowned with those
impressive and haunting figures, &ldquo;Grief&rdquo; and
&ldquo;History,&rdquo; which are considered as among the
most classically beautiful and significant in the
range of modern sculpture.</p>

<p>In the early winter of 1907 Mr. Simmons
was invited by the American Ambassador to
the Court of St. James, Hon. Whitelaw Reid,
to send for Dorchester House, London, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
busts of distinguished Americans,&mdash;those of
Alexander Hamilton, Chief Justice Chase, and
Hon. James G. Blaine, which Mr. Reid, in visiting
the Roman studios of Mr. Simmons, had seen
and greatly admired. The Ambassador observed
that he &ldquo;would like a few Americans, as well
as so many Roman Emperors,&rdquo; about him.</p>

<p>These portrait busts all reveal an amazing
force and mastery of work. The fine sculptural
effect of the Hamilton and the wonderful
blending of subtle delicacy of touch and vigor
of treatment with which the nobility of character
is expressed, mark this bust as something
exceptional in portrait art. It has a matchless
dignity and serene poise. The bust of Chief
Justice Chase is a faithful and speaking reproduction
of the very presence of its subject,
instinct with vitality; and the fire and force
and brilliancy of the bust of Hon. James G.
Blaine fairly sweeps the visitor off his feet.
The modelling is done with an apparent instantaneousness
of power that is the highest realization
of creative art. It is the magnetic Blaine,
the impassioned and eloquent statesman, that
rises before the gazer.</p>

<p>Mr. Simmons has long been a commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
figure in plastic art. No American sculptor
abroad has, perhaps, received so many important
public commissions as have been given to him.
He has created nearly a score of memorial
groups; he has modelled over one hundred portrait
busts and statues. His industry has kept
step with his genius. The latest success of Mr.
Simmons in the line of monumental art is the
statue (in bronze) of Alexander Hamilton,
which was unveiled at Paterson, N. J., in May
of 1907. The splendidly poised figure, the dignity,
the serene strength and yet the intense
energy of the expression and of the entire pose
are a revelation in the art of the portrait statue.</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/geniusb.jpg"><img src="images/genius.jpg" width="400" height="214" alt="&ldquo;THE GENIUS OF PROGRESS LEADING THE NATIONS&rdquo; Franklin Simmons" title="&ldquo;THE GENIUS OF PROGRESS LEADING THE NATIONS&rdquo; Franklin Simmons" /></a>
<p class="caption noi"><small>&ldquo;THE GENIUS OF PROGRESS LEADING THE NATIONS&rdquo;<br /> Franklin Simmons</small></p>
</div>

<p>It is not, however, true that Mr. Simmons
has ever resigned himself to the necessity of
producing portrait and memorial sculpture exclusively.
In the realm of the purely ideal Mr.
Simmons finds his most felicitous field for creative
work. A bas-relief entitled &ldquo;The Genius
of Progress Leading the Nations,&rdquo; with all its
splendid fire and action, the <i>motif</i> being that of
the spirits Life and Light beating down and
driving out the spirits of darkness and evil;
&ldquo;The Angel of the Resurrection,&rdquo; with its glad,
triumphant assertion of the power of the immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
life; the poetry and sacredness of maternity
as typified in the &ldquo;Mother of Moses;&rdquo; the
statues of the &ldquo;Galatea&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Medusa,&rdquo;
and other ideal creations, indicate &ldquo;the vision
and the faculty divine&rdquo; of Mr. Simmons. To a
very great degree his art is that which the
French describe as the grand manner, and to
this is added a spiritual quality, a power of
radiating the intellectual purpose, the profounder
thought and the aspiration of the subject
represented.</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 282px;">
<a href="images/mosesb.jpg"><img src="images/moses.jpg" width="282" height="400" alt="&ldquo;MOTHER OF MOSES&rdquo; Franklin Simmons" title="&ldquo;MOTHER OF MOSES&rdquo; Franklin Simmons" /></a>
<p class="caption noi"><small>&ldquo;MOTHER OF MOSES&rdquo;<br /> Franklin Simmons</small></p>
</div>

<p>One of the most charming of these ideal
works is a statue of &ldquo;Penelope,&rdquo; represented
seated in the chair, her rich robe falling in
graceful folds, and the little Greek fillet binding
her hair. The face bears a meditative expression,
into which has entered a hint of pathos
and wistfulness in the dawning wonder as to
whether, after all, Ulysses will return. The
classic beauty of the pose; the exquisite modelling
of the bust and arms and hands, every
curve and contour so ideally lovely; the distinction
of the figure in its noble and refined patrician
elegance, are combined to render this work
one that well deserves immortality in art, and
to rank as a masterpiece in modern sculpture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Another of his ideal figures, &ldquo;The Promised
Land,&rdquo; is a work of great spiritual exaltation
and beauty. An Israelite woman has just arrived
at the point when before her vision gleams
the &ldquo;Promised Land&rdquo;; the face tells its own
story of all she has passed through,&mdash;the trials,
the sadness, the obstacles to be overcome; but
now she sees the fulfilment of her hopes and
dreams. It is a most interesting creation, and
one in which is portrayed the artist&rsquo;s spiritual
insight and susceptibility to poetic exaltation.
To one visitor to Mr. Simmons&rsquo;s studio this
statue suggested the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair on her sight it gleams,&mdash;the Promised Land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose of dawn sifts through the azure air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her weariness and toil and care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanish, as if from her some tender hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted the burden, and transformed the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this undreamed-of sense of joy and power!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapture and the ecstasy divine<br /></span>

<p>In a statuette in bronze called &ldquo;Valley
Forge,&rdquo; Mr. Simmons has fairly incarnated the
entire spirit of the Revolutionary period in that
mysterious way recognized only in its result;
all that unparalleled epoch of tragic intensity
and sublime triumph lives again in this work.
The fidelity to a lofty ideal which essentially
characterizes Mr. Simmons is as unswerving as
that of Merlin, who followed &ldquo;The Gleam.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 9em;"><div class="stanza">

<p>This American sculptor who, in his early
youth, sought the artistic atmosphere of Rome
as the environment most stimulating to his
dawning power, who accepted with unfailing
courage the incidental privations of art life in
a foreign land more renowned for beauty than
for comfort, who</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never turned his back, but marched breast forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never doubted clouds would break,&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noi">has expressed his message in many purely ideal
works,&mdash;the message that the true artist must
always give to the world and that leads humanity
to the crowning truth of life, that of the
ceaseless progress of the soul in its immortality.</p>

<p>For the brief and significant assertion of
the apostle condenses the most profound truth
of life when he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
minded is life and peace.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In these words are imaged the supreme purpose
of all the experiences of the life on earth;
and to the artist whose works bear this lofty
message of the triumph of spirituality, his reward
shall appear, not in the praise of men,
but in the effect on character that his efforts
have aided to exalt; in the train of nobler influences
that his work shall perpetually inspire
and create.</p>

<p>Mr. Simmons has always found Rome potent
in fascination. One may not want to go to
St. Peter&rsquo;s every day, but one knows it is there,
and there is some inexplicable satisfaction in
being where it is possible to easily enter this
impressive interior. One may not go near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Forum for a month, or even a season, but the
knowledge that one may find it and the wonderful
Palatine Hill any hour of any day is a perpetual
delight. The Vatican galleries, with
their great masterpieces; the Sistine Chapel, the
stately, splendid impressiveness of San Giovanni
Laterano; the wanderings in Villa Borghese, and
the picturesque climbing of the Spanish steps,
even all the inconveniences and deprivations,
become a part of the story of Rome which the
artist absorbs and loves.</p>

<p>The studios of Mr. Simmons in the Via San
Nicolo da Tolentino are a centre of artistic
resort, and his personal life is one of distinction
amid the picturesque beauty and enchantment
of the Eternal City.</p>

<p>For many years (until the death of Mrs.
Simmons in 1905) the sculptor and his wife had
their home in the beautiful Palazzo Tamagno
in the Via Agostino Depretis, where one of
those spacious apartments of twenty to thirty
rooms, only to be found in a Roman palace, was
made by them a brilliant centre of social life.
Mrs. Simmons was herself a musical artist, with
impassioned devotion to music; and her rare personal
charm and distinction of presence drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
around her a most interesting circle. Her receptions
were for many years a noted feature of
Roman society. The social life in Rome is
very brilliant, interesting, and fascinating. The
sight-seeing is a kind of attendant atmosphere,&mdash;the
perpetual environment offering, but not
intruding itself. People come to Rome for reasons
quite disconnected with the Golden House
of Nero or the latest arch√¶ological discoveries
in the Forum. The present, rather than the
past, calls to them, and the present, too, is
resplendent and alluring.</p>

<p>Of the foreign painters in Rome, Charles
Walter Stetson, whose work recalls the glory
of the old Italian masters, is especially distinguished
for his genius as a colorist. No visitor
in Rome can afford to miss the studio of one of
the most imaginative of modern artists. A
wonderful picture still in process is a genre
work with several figures, called &ldquo;Music.&rdquo; An
idyllic scene of a festa amid the ilex trees&mdash;with
the Italian sky and the golden sunshine
pervading a luminous atmosphere, while the joyous
abandon of the dancers appeals to all who
love Italy&mdash;is one of the many beautiful pictorial
scenes of Mr. Stetson which enchant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
eye and haunt the imagination. Another picture
is called &ldquo;Beggars,&rdquo;&mdash;a name that illy
suggests its splendor. There is the fa√ßade of
a church to which a long flight of steps leads
up, a procession of cardinals and friars in their
rich robes, while at one side the groups of
beggars shrink into the darkness. It is an
impressive commentary upon life.</p>

<p>For a long period, through the early and
middle years of the nineteenth century, Rome
held her place as the world centre of modern
artistic activity. Great works of poetic and
ideal sculpture elevated the general public taste
to a high degree of appreciation. The standards
were not ingeniously adjusted to mere
spectacular methods whose sole appeal was to
the crude fancy of possible patrons. Art held
her absolute and inviolate ideals, and the spirit
of her votaries might well have been interpreted
in Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&ldquo;I, who love my art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would never wish it lower to suit my stature.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tone of public appreciation is raised to
a high quality only when the artist refuses to
sell his soul for a mess of pottage. He may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to be sure, need the pottage, but the price is
too great. Rather will he find his attitude expressed
in these wonderful lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&ldquo;I can live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least my soul&rsquo;s life without alms from men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if it be in heaven instead of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let heaven look to it&mdash;I am not afraid.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All art that has within itself true vitality must
ever be the leader and the creator of the popular
taste; only when it falls into decadence does
it become the servile follower.</p>

<p>It is a serious question as to the degree in
which the art of to-day keeps faith with the
eternal ideals. The great expositions of the
past quarter of a century, while they have contributed
immeasurably to the popularization of
art and to the familiarization of the public with
the work of individual painters and sculptors,
have yet, in many ways, been a demoralizing
influence in their insidious temptation to produce
pictures or plastic art calculated to arrest
immediate attention, thus putting a premium
on the spectacular, the sensational, on that
which makes the most immediate and direct
appeal to the senses. The work becomes fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a personal document wrought with perhaps an
almost amazing finesse, but utterly failing in
power to inspire joyous sensibility to beauty
or to impart to the gazer that glow of radiant
energy which lofty art invariably communicates
to all who respond to its infinite exaltation.</p>

<p>All great art is inspired by religious ideals.
Painting and sculpture give to these a presence.
Under their creative power are these ideals
manifested. To embody them in living form
becomes the absolute responsibility of the artist.
In Greece all the fortunate conditions to produce
great art were curiously combined and pre-eminently
supported by the conjunction of events
and by the prevailing sentiment of the time.
The artist drew his inspiration from the most
exalted conception of life embodied in gods
rather than in men. Art, too, was an affair
of the state. It was the supreme interest and
held national importance. The temple was
erected to form an inclosure for the statue,
rather than that the statue was created as an
adornment for the temple. The greatest gifts
were consecrated to the service of art, and under
these stimulating influences it is little wonder
that artistic creation achieved that vital potency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which has thrilled all succeeding centuries and
has communicated to them something of the
divine air of that remote period. With the
Renaissance in Italy art culminated in the immortal
work of Raphael and Michael Angelo.
In the Sistine Chapel, where that sublime
grouping of prophets and sibyls speaks of the
very miracle of art in their impassioned fire and
glow; where the figures, the pose, the draperies
are so grandly noble and infused with dignity
and presence,&mdash;the very atmosphere is vocal
with the language of the spirit and the expressions
of religious reverence. These marvellous
shapes of grandeur and sublime intimations
carry the soul into a conscious communion with
the divine. In these stupendous works Michael
Angelo has given to all the ages the message of
the highest exaltation of art. In the technique,
in the marvellous dignity of the sentiment, in
the depth of the feeling involved, in the grace
and power of the composition, these works
embody the artistic possibilities of painting.</p>

<p class="caption noi"><small>&ldquo;LA PIETA,&rdquo; ST. PETER&rsquo;S, ROME<br /> Michael Angelo</small></p>
</div>

<p>Are such works as those of Canova and
Thorwaldsen no longer created?</p>

<p>Can it be that art is no longer of national
importance? In our own country vast appropriations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
are made for internal improvements
of all kinds, while art that kindles and re-enforces
life is almost ignored. Our government&mdash;the
government of the richest country in the
world&mdash;appropriated $200,000 for a memorial
monument to General Grant to be placed in
Washington, while Italy&mdash;whose resources are so
slender in comparison&mdash;appropriates seven million
dollars&mdash;thirty-five times the amount&mdash;for
her great monument to Victor Emmanuel which
is now being erected in Rome to stand near the
Capitol and the Palace of the Quirinale. Great
art has always been closely associated with
great devotion to religious ideals. The artist
was the servant of the Lord, and it was his
supreme purpose to embody the aspirations of
the age and render his works a full and complete
symbol of those true realities of life which
have their being in the spiritual universe rather
than in the changing temporal world of the outer
universe. The so-called realism of the day is
based on a false interpretation. &ldquo;The things
that are seen are temporal, while the things that
are not seen are eternal.&rdquo; True realism is in
spiritual qualities, not in physical attributes.
True realism is found in such works as Canova&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
sublime group, where the figures of Religion
and of Death forever impress all who stand
before this magnificent monument; it is found
in Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christ;&rdquo; in Franklin Simmons&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Angel of the Resurrection,&rdquo;&mdash;in such
works as those that have a language for the
soul, rather than in a &ldquo;Saturnalia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, another fatal rock on which art must
inevitably make shipwreck is the theory that it
is good to perpetuate ugliness, in either painting
or in sculpture. The permanent reality of
life is beauty. So far as any person or object
departs from this enduring reality, so far it is
the result of distortion and deformity, and these,
being the temporary, the accidental, the deficient,
should not be perpetuated in ideal creation.
It is an Apollo who embodies the permanent
ideal of manhood&mdash;not a cripple or a hunchback.
Still further: art should not only refuse
to embody the defective, which is a mere negative;
it should not only give form to the utmost
perfection it beholds in nature or in humanity,
but beyond this the responsibility is upon the
artist to penetrate into loftier realms, to catch
the vision not revealed to mortals. The artist
is, by virtue of his high calling, a co-worker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
with God. An English wit has declared that
life copies art rather than that art copies life.
In this he expresses a truth rather than a merely
clever epigram. It is the artist&rsquo;s business to
lead, not to follow. Only as he leads does he
fulfil his divinely appointed destiny. &ldquo;I maintain
that life is not a form of energy,&rdquo; writes
Sir Oliver Lodge; &ldquo;that it is not included in
our present physical categories; that its explanation
is still to be sought. And it appears to me
to belong to a separate order of existence,
which interacts with this material frame of
things, and while here exerts guidance and control
on the energy which already here exists;
for although they alter the quantity of energy
no whit, and though they merely utilize available
energy like any other machine, live things
are able to direct inorganic terrestrial energy
along new and special paths, so as to achieve
results without which such living agency could
not have occurred.&rdquo; Does it for an instant seem
that a great scientist&rsquo;s theoretical speculations of
the laws of the universe and of organic life have
no connection with the province of art? On
the contrary. Truly does Balzac exclaim: &ldquo;Is
not God the whole of science, the all of love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the source of poetry?&rdquo; The artist is he who
enters into the divine realm; who discerns the
divine creations as the true ideals of humanity,
and who interprets to the world the sublime
significance of the divine thought. Shall such
an artist degrade his power by portraying ugliness&mdash;the
mere defects of negations and distortions?
Shall he degrade life by calling these
the realities?</p>

<p>The painter or sculptor who holds that it is
as truly art to represent distortion and repulsiveness
as it is to represent beauty is as false
to his high calling as would be the poet who
should insist that doggerel and mere commonplace
truisms expressed in rhyme are poetry.
Compare, for example, two statues, Cecioni&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<i>La Madre</i>,&rdquo; in which a woman&rsquo;s utter lack of
personal attraction is so complete as to make
her fairly repulsive to the gazer, and the
&ldquo;Mother of Moses,&rdquo; by Franklin Simmons, in
which the mystic beauty, the very ideal of maternity,
is embodied. Which of these statues is
calculated to uplift and to exalt all who come
near? This marvellously beautiful creation of
Mr. Simmons shows a woman of exquisite delicacy
and loveliness sitting, slightly bending forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
holding her baby to her breast. The
modelling of the draped figure with the bare
arms and neck revealing the tender curves, the
yielding delicacy of the flesh and that inscrutable
light upon the beautiful countenance, whose
expression suggests that she is looking far into
the future of the infant whom she holds in
her arms, are a wonderful portrayal of the
mystery and the sacredness of motherhood.
The one statue degrades maternity; the other
ennobles and exalts. The one embodies a pernicious
and a false ideal; the other embodies
the ideal that must appeal to all that is noble
and divine in human life, and it thus ministers
to moral progress by its contribution to the
elevation of the social tone. For indeed, life
follows art. It is art that exerts this powerful
influence upon life which it may lead to loftier
heights or drag down to the moral abyss. The
artist is not merely the portrayer of existing
types; he is the inspirer of those ideal types
which human life should recognize as its pattern,
its model to be followed and ultimately achieved.
The world needs ideal and poetic art to minister
to the attainment of the true social life and to the
full and complete expression of man himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not the visions of Fra Angelico and Botticelli
still inspire the artist of to-day with the
absolute realization of all the deep significance
of the past?</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Is there never a retroscope mirror,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the realms and corners of space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can give us a glimpse of the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the soldiers face to face?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Religion and art are inseparably united. In
its true significance religion takes precedence
of all else in that its influence is felt in
every department and in every direction
and expression of man&rsquo;s activity. It is the
inexhaustible fountain of that lofty energy
which communicates itself to every channel
that carries inspiration to life and to art.
Religion is the influence that redeems the
mere shallow, surface presentation,&mdash;the petty
trick to capture popularity, and holds art
true to its real purpose. The glory of the
medi√¶val art of Italy owed its greatness to
religion. Cimabue and Giotto were directly
inspired by that spring of a diviner life
given to Italy and later to the world of
that &ldquo;sweet saint,&rdquo; Francis of Assisi. In an
age of cruelty and terror he brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
new message that man is dear to God; that
the soul is ceaselessly joyful; that man, created
in the divine image, is a part of the
divine life, and that only when he lives in
this response and recognition does he truly
live at all. In this restatement of the truth
that Jesus came to proclaim, St. Francis
opened the way for a revival of art, and
opened the gates of that infinite and divine
energy which has immortally recorded itself for
all ages in the &ldquo;Divina Comedia&rdquo; of Dante.
The irresistible wave of power which resulted
from that liberating of thought, feeling, and
emotion by the work of St. Francis expressed
itself in the sublimest poem of all the ages, and
in that glorious triumph of art that is still the
treasure and the source of artistic inspiration.</p>

<p>It is only when the world is lifted out of the
limitations of the material by a period of great
art that humanity is brought into close and
inspiring relation with the living Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Social</span> life in Rome is no misnomer. From the
most stately and beautiful ceremonials of balls
at the court of the Quirinale, in ducal palaces,
or at the embassies; of dinners whose every
detail suggests stage pictures in their magnificence,
to the simple afternoon tea, where conversation
and music enchant the hours; the
morning call <i>en t√™te-√†-t√™te</i>, and the morning
stroll, or the late afternoon drive,&mdash;a season in
Rome prefigures itself, by the necromancy of
retrospective vision, as a resplendent panorama
of pictorial scenes. There rise before one those
mornings, all gold and azure, of loitering over
the stone parapet on Monte Pincio, gazing down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
on the city in her most alluring mood. The
new bridge that is to connect the Pincio with
the Villa Borghese is a picturesque feature in
its unfinished state; but the vision traverses the
deep ravine and revels in the scene of the
Borghese grounds carpeted with flowers. Its
picturesque slopes under the great trees, with
a view of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s dome in the near
distance, are the resort of morning strollers,
who find that lovely picture of Charles Walter
Stetson&rsquo;s&mdash;a stretch of landscape under the
ilex trees, the scarlet gowns of the divinity
students giving vivid accents of color here and
there&mdash;fairly reproduced in nature before their
vision. One should never be in haste as the
bewildering beauty of the Roman spring weaves
its emerald fantasies on grass and trees, and
touches into magical bloom the scarlet poppies
that flame over all the meadows, and caress
roses and hyacinths and lilies of the valley into
delicate bloom and floating fragrance until the
Eternal City is no more Rome, but Arcady,
instead&mdash;one should never be in haste to toss
his penny into the <i>Fontane de Trevi</i>. Yet in
another way it may work for him an immediate
spell that defies all other necromancy. Judiciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
thrown in, on the very eve of departure,
it is the conjurer that insures his return; but at
any time prior to this it may even weave the
irresistible enchantment that falls upon him and
may prevent his leaving at all. Nor can he
summon up the moral courage to regret even
the missing of all other engagements, and the
failure to keep faith with his plans. For in
the May days Rome falls upon him anew, like
a revelation, and he is ready to confess that he
has never seen her who sees her not in her
springtime loveliness. The Italian winter by no
means lives up to its reputation. It is not the
chill of any one special day that discourages
one from any further effort to continue in this
vale of tears, but the cold that has, apparently,
the chill and dampness and cold of all those
two thousand and two hundred and sixty winters
that have gone before which concentrate
themselves in the atmosphere. One could presumably
endure with some degree of courage, if
not equanimity, the chill in the air of any <i>one</i>
winter; but when all the chill and cold that has
ever existed in more than the two thousand
winters of the past concentrates itself in the
winter, say, of 1906-7, why, patience ceases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to be a virtue although one that the sojourner
in Rome is particularly called upon to practise
if he fares forth to visit churches and galleries
in the winter.</p>

<p>Torrents of rain pour down, rivalling the
cloud-bursts of Arizona. Virgil&rsquo;s cave of the
winds apparently lets loose its sharpest blasts.
Tramontana and sirocco alternate, and each is
more unendurable than the other.</p>

<p>The encircling mountains are white with
snow. The streets are a sea of mud, for they
are paved with small stones, and except in the
new Villa Ludovisi quarter and along the Via
Nazionale and a few other of the newer thoroughfares
there are no sidewalks, the foot passengers
(in all old Rome) pressing close to the
wall to avoid the dangerously near proximity
of carts and cabs. This rough pavement makes
all driving hard and walking difficult. The
Roman lady, indeed, does not walk; and the
visitors who cannot forego the joy of daily
promenades enter into the feelings of that
nation which is said to take its pleasures sadly.
But spring works a transformation scene. The
air is filled with the most transparent shining
haze; the sky lacks little of that intense, melting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
blue that characterizes the ineffable beauty of
the skies in Arizona; and ruins and fragments
and strange relics&mdash;ghosts of the historic
past&mdash;are all enshrined in trailing green and riotous
blossoms. To drive on the terraced roads of
Monte Mario with all Rome and the emerald-green
Campagna before one; through the
romantic &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Lane,&rdquo; walled in by roses
and myrtle; to enjoy the local life, full of gayety
and brilliancy, is to know Rome in her most
gracious aspects. One goes for strolls in the
old Colonna Gardens, where still remain the
ruins of the Temple of the Sun and of the
Baths of Constantine. The terraces offer lovely
views over the city. The old palace is occupied
by the present Prince Colonna, and it is
not unfrequently the scene of most elaborate
and gorgeous receptions where the traditional
Roman splendor is to be found. A series of
arched bridges over the narrow street of the
Via della Pilotta connect the Gardens with the
Colonna Palace in the Piazza San Apostoli.
Very fine old sarcophagi are half buried in
trailing vines on the slope of the hill, dark with
magnificent cypress trees. The Colonna Gardens
are a very dream of the past, in their ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of old temples, their shattered statues, their
strange old tablets and inscriptions, and their
grand view of the Capitol.</p>

<p>In one&rsquo;s retrospective vision of a Roman
season all the inconveniences and discomforts
of the winter disappear, leaving only the beauty
and the enjoyment to be &ldquo;developed,&rdquo; as the
photographer would say, on the sensitive plate
of memory.</p>

<p>No one really knows Rome until he has
watched the transcendent loveliness of spring
investing every nook and corner of the Eternal
City. The picturesque Spanish steps are a very
garden of fragrance, the lower steps of the terraced
flight being taken possession of by the
flower venders who display their wares,&mdash;masses
of white lilac, flame-colored roses, rose
and purple hyacinths and baskets of violets and
carnations. Did all this fragrance and beauty
send up its incense to Keats as he lay in the
house adjoining, with the musical plash of Bernini&rsquo;s
fountain under his window? It is pleasant
to know that by the appreciation of
American and English authors, the movement
effectively directed by Robert Underwood Johnson,
this house consecrated to a poet&rsquo;s memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
has been purchased to be a permanent memorial
to Keats and to Shelley. A library of their
works will be arranged in it; and portraits, busts,
and all mementos that can be collected of
these poets will render this memorial one of the
beautiful features of Rome.</p>

<p>From the flower venders and the circulating
libraries in the Piazza di Spagna that allure one
in the morning, from the fascinating glitter of
the little Via Condotti which is, in its way, the
rue de la Paix of Rome, one leisurely climbs
the steps to where the great obelisk looms up
in front of the Convent Church of the Trinit√†
di Monti and on, across the Piazza di Trinit√†,
toward the Pincian, one wanders along the
brow of the hill surmounted by the low stone
parapet. The view is a dream of beauty. Over
the valley lies Monte Mario, crowned with the
Villa Madama, silhouetted against the blue
Roman sky; and the commanding dome of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, the splendid new white marble buildings
of the Law Courts, the domes of other
churches, all make up a picturesque panorama,
while on the Janiculum the great equestrian
statue of Garibaldi can be descried. Strolling
on, one turns into the gardens of the Villa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Medici, the French Academy of Art, in which
the present director, the great Carolus Duran,
is domiciled and in which twenty-four students&mdash;of
painting, sculpture, music, and architecture&mdash;are
maintained at the expense of the
French government for several years, the twenty
four being chosen from those who have given
signal proof of their ability. The Villa Medici
has, perhaps, a more beautiful site than any
other building in Rome. Facing the west, with
the Janiculum and Monte Mario forever before
it, while below lies the Piazza di Spagna and
the Piazza del Popolo, and all the changing
splendors of the sunset sky as a perpetual picture
gallery, the situation is, indeed, magnificent.
It is still conceivable, however, that Monsieur
Carolus Duran must have many quarters
of an hour when he longs for the brilliancy and
the movement and the stimulus of his Paris.
The gardens of the Villa Medici are large, but
they are laid out with narrow paths bordered
with box, forming a wall as impervious as if
of stone, and dark and damp by the shade
of foliage. These walks are paved with gravel,
and are always damp. These formal rectangles
and alleys are utterly shut in, so that in any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
part one can see only the two dense green walls
of box that inclose him and the glimpse of sky
overhead,&mdash;not precisely a cheering promenade.
This is the Italian idea of a garden. Much
broken sculpture, weather-stained and defective,
is placed all along the way, and the
perpetual Roman fountain is always gushing
somewhere.</p>

<p class="caption noi"><small>VILLA MEDICI, ROME</small></p>
</div>

<p>Another phase of the Roman season may rise
before one in the stately beauty of any old historic
palace, where the hostess, all grace and
sweetness, receives her guests in the apartment
in which Galileo had been confined when imprisoned
in Rome. The approach to this <i>piano
nobile</i> was up a flight of easily graded marble
stairs, where in frequent niches stood old
statues. The large windows in the corridor on
the landing were curtained with pale yellow,
thus creating a golden light to fall on the old
sculptured marbles. One salon was decorated
with Flaxman&rsquo;s drawings on the wall, in their
classical outlines. From a steep, dark stone
stairway, down which one descended (at the
imminent risk of a broken neck in the darkness
and from the irregular stairs rudely carved
in the stone), one emerged on a landing, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
little door opened into the balcony of the chapel,
a curious, gloomy place, with tombs and altar
and shrine, and some very poor old paintings.
One&rsquo;s progress to it recalled the lines from
Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ulalume&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;By a route, obscure and lonely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunted by ill angels only.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then, sitting in one of the richly decorated
salons at afternoon tea in this same old palace
one day, while an accomplished harpist was
discoursing delicate music from its vibrating
chords, flights of birds kept passing a window,
making a scene like that of a Wagner opera.
The groups present, largely of the Roman
nobility, the titled aristocracy, resembling so
closely some of the old portraits in the palazzo
that it was easy to recognize that they were all
one people, descendants of the same race.</p>

<p>Many of the guests looked, indeed, as if they
had stepped from out the sumptuously carved
frames on the wall. At these pretty festas one
meets much of the resident Roman world. The
guests assembled seem to be speaking in all the
romance languages. There are Russian and
Spanish as well as Italian, French, German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and English at these alluring teas. All the
salons of the spacious apartments are thrown
open, and the men in their picturesque court
dress or military costume, and the women and
girls in dainty gowns, make up an alluring scene.
The salons are richly furnished and abound in
works of art, old pictures, inlaid cabinets, carvings,
rich vases, busts, and statuettes. The
library, with its wealth of books; the music
room; the salon for dancing; the supper room,
and the quiet rooms where groups gather before
the blazing open fires, grateful in these lofty
rooms whose temperature suggests the frozen
circles of Dante,&mdash;all make up a delightful
picture. One meets the most varying individualities.
A Russian lady of title may confide
her conviction that her country is ruined,
and that she never desires to return to it. Italy
is the country that attracts not only political
refugees from other European countries, but
many who are out of sympathy with conditions
elsewhere and who find the cosmopolitan society
and the varied interests of this land of sunshine
their most enjoyable environment.</p>

<p>One pleasant feature of a Roman winter is
that of the usual course of lectures given by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Professor Lanciani. The celebrated arch√¶ologist
is a man of special personal charm, and his
conversation, as well as his public lectures, is
full of interest and value. The lectures are
given under the auspices of the <a name="tn138" id="tn138"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Societa'">Societ√†</ins> Archeologica,
and a special subject recently discussed
was the celebration to be held in 1911 in Rome.
One project for this celebration includes the
plan to lay out a carriage road around the
Forum and the Palatine, and also around
the Baths of Titus and of Caracalla, extending
the drive to all those places included between
the Appian and the Latin Way, the Villa
Celimontana and the Circus Maximus.</p>

<p>Professor Lanciani discussed the artistic history
of Rome and the different appearances the
city took on in different periods; the regulation
plan drawn up by Julius C√¶sar and accepted
and carried out by Augustus, by which one-fifth
of the total area of the city was reserved
for public parks. In the third century of the
empire the city was inclosed by parks and
crossed from end to end by delightful portico
gardens, where valuable works of art were collected.
During the period of the Renaissance
there were the famous villas and the Cesarini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Park on the slopes of the Esquiline, and after
regretting the many unnecessary acts of vandalism
committed since 1870 in Rome, Professor
Lanciani suggested that a complete
reconstruction of the Baths of Caracalla should
be made, to serve in 1911 as the Exhibition
Building. He believed no artistic difficulties
would present themselves, as in the fifteenth
century different architects took plaster casts
of the decorations of the statues and of every
detail of the Baths. The arch√¶ological exhibition
would be arranged in the two large halls,
another hall would be for concerts, another for
lectures, the others for different congresses to
be held.</p>

<p>In this way Rome would inaugurate for 1911
the Medi√¶val Museum in Castel Sant&rsquo;Angelo,
the medi√¶val collections in the Torre degli
Anguillara, and the grand arch√¶ological exhibition
in the reconstructed Baths of Caracalla.</p>

<p>Italian women are by no means behind the
age in their organizations to aid in social progress.
The most important one in Italy is that
of the leading women of the nobility and aristocracy,
called &ldquo;The Society for Women&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Work,&rdquo; which holds annual meetings, over
which Lady Aberdeen, the president of the
International Council, and the Contessa Spalletti,
the president of the National Council of
Italy, preside. Many of the prominent women
of the Italian nobility are taking active part in
the larger outlook for women; and in this movement
Margherita, <i>la Regina Madre</i>, leads the
way, supported by a large following of the
titled nobility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margherita holds the hearts of the people,&rdquo;
remarked Cora, Contessa di Brazz√° Savorgnan,
at a brilliant little dinner one night, and no
expression could more admirably represent the
feeling of the nation toward the Queen Mother.</p>

<p>Queen Elena as the reigning sovereign has,
of course, her exclusive royal prerogatives, and
she has youth and initiative and precedence;
but Margherita is a most attractive woman,
with learning and accomplishments galore, and
she has an art of conversation that allures and
fascinates visiting foreigners of learning and
wit, as well as of rank. Roman society is not
large numerically, and the same people are constantly
meeting and consolidating their many
points of contact and interest. Social life in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
these Italian cities is the supreme occupation of
the residents, and one must concede that in
proportion as one meets the same people constantly
does society gain in dramatic interest.
With each person who is in any sense an individual
the play of life begins. It gains in
dramatic sequence as it proceeds. The Eternal
City is a wonderful scenic setting for the human
drama.</p>

<p>Local gossip suggests perceptible rivalry between
the stately palace of the King and the
pink palace on the hill, in which Margherita
holds her state with not less ceremony than
that observed at the Court of the Quirinale. It
is a beautiful thing for a country to have in it a
woman of high position, of leisure and of culture,
who is so admirably fitted to be the friend
of the people as is Margherita. She is a connoisseur
in art; she has a most intelligent interest
in science; she is a critical lover of literature;
she is a wise and judicious and deeply sympathetic
leader in all philanthropic work and purposes.
One can hardly visit painter or poet or
artist in any line, or school, institute, or association,
but that he hears of the personal
sympathy and encouragement bestowed by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
noble and beautiful Italian Queen,&mdash;the <i>Regina
Madre</i>.</p>

<p>Practically there are, indeed, two courts in
Rome; that of the Palazzo Margherita seeming
to quite rival that held at the Palazzo Quirinale.
The palace of the Queen Mother is an imposing
three-story structure of pink-hued marble, with
beautiful gardens and terraces, and adjoining
it, in the palace grounds, is a marble villa,
used for the entertainment of royal guests.
This palace has been the residence of Margherita
when in Rome since the tragic death of
King Umberto, in 1900. It is in the Ludovisi
quarter, and stands on the very site of the Gardens
of Sallust. The Queen Mother receives
noted visitors constantly, and entertains visiting
royalties and members of the aristocracy.
No great man of science, literature, and art
visits Rome without seeking a presentation to
the liberal-minded and accomplished <i>Regina
Madre</i>, who is one of the most winning and
attractive of all the royal women of Europe.</p>

<p>It has become quite a feature in introducing
young girls to present them first in private audience
to Margherita, and then later to Queen
Elena at the Court of the Quirinale. Surely no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
girl could be given a lovelier idea of womanhood
than that embodied in the Dowager Queen.
When the poet Carducci died in the early
months of 1907, Margherita sent beautiful messages
of consolation to his family, and, later,
to his home city of Bologna she sent the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I announce that I make a free gift to the
city of Bologna of the house where Giosu√® Carducci
passed the last years of his life, and the
library he collected there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bologna, that showed such affectionate hospitality
for Giosu√® Carducci for so many years,
and surrounded him with so much devotion,
will know, I feel sure, how to carefully preserve
this remembrance of the greatest poet of modern
Italy.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Margherita.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The Syndic replied in a letter hardly less fine
in its expression of Bologna&rsquo;s appreciation, and
with assurances that the name of the first Queen
of Italy will in future be forever associated with
Italy&rsquo;s greatest modern poet.</p>

<p>The Regio Palazzo del Quirinale is near the
Capitol, in the older part of the city, and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a small part of this is shown to visitors when
the King and Queen are in residence. The
Sala Regia may be seen, the chapel in which
are preserved a large number of the wreaths
and the addresses sent from all parts of the
civilized world on the occasion of the death of
Victor Emmanuel II, and a suite of reception
rooms, the throne room with many historic portraits,
the Sala des Ambassadeurs, and the
audience chamber, containing Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Triumphal Procession of Alexander the
Great,&rdquo; a gift from Napoleon I. In the small
chapel of the Annunciation is an altar piece by
Guido Reni.</p>

<p>To artists the Queen Mother is most generously
kind. One of the younger Italian sculptors,
Turillo Sindoni, Cavaliere of the Crown
of Italy, whose latest creation is a very beautiful
statue of St. Agnes, has his studios in the
Via del Babuino, and to especially favored
visitors he sometimes exhibits a beautiful letter
that he received from Margherita, who purchased
two of his statues. With the letter expressing
her warm appreciation of his art was
an exquisite gift of jewelled sleeve-links.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fascinating lectures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Professor Lanciani and the valuable and interesting
work in the Forum that is being accomplished
under the efficient directorship of
Commendatore Boni, yet all the roads that traditionally
lead to Rome do not converge to the
palace on the Palatine. Modern Rome is only
mildly arch√¶ological, and while it takes occasional
recognition of the ancient monuments,
and drives to the crypt of old St. Agnes, to
the tomb of Cecilia Metella, and may manage
a descent into the catacomb of St. Calixtus, it
is far more actively interested in its dancing
and dining and driving. As a scenic background
for festivities Rome is a success, and as
one comes into social touch with the titled
nobility, and the resident life, by birth or adoption,
one finds a city of infinite human interest
and picturesque possibilities.</p>

<p>Between the &ldquo;Whites&rdquo; (the loyal followers of
the Palazzo Quirinale and the King) and the
&ldquo;Blacks&rdquo; (the devoted followers of the Palazzo
Vaticano and the Pope) a great gulf is fixed
over which no one may cross.</p>

<p>Pope Pius X is wonderfully accessible, considering
the great responsibilities and duties he
has on him, and his generous goodness, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
gracious tact and the beauty of his spirit endear
him to all, Catholic or Protestant alike, for
every one recognizes in him the Christian
gentleman, whose ideals of gentleness and inspiring
helpfulness impress themselves on all
who are so fortunate as to meet him.</p>

<p>The most impressive ceremonial receptions
of the &ldquo;Blacks&rdquo; are those given at the Spanish
Embassy in the Piazza di Spagna. At the Embassy
or in the private palace of any Roman
noble which a Cardinal honors by accepting an
invitation, he is received according to a most
picturesque old Roman custom. At the foot of
the stairs two servants bearing lighted torches
meet his Eminence, and, making a profound
obeisance, escort him to the portals of the grand
reception salon and await, in the corridor, his
return. On his departure they escort him in
the same way down the staircase.</p>

<p>In the College of Cardinals and among the
many interesting individualities of the Vatican,
the most marked figure is that of the Cardinal
Secretary of State, Merry del Val. He occupies
the Borgia apartments, which are hung
with tapestry and ornamented with the most
unique and valuable articles <i>de vertu</i>,&mdash;wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
vases, inlaid cabinets, old tapestries,
paintings, statues, busts, and ivories. These
Borgia apartments are one of the most interesting
features of the Palazzo Vaticano, and
may be seen now and then by special permission
when the Cardinal secretary is out, or when he
may be pleased to retire into his more private
salons in the apartment while the others are
shown. Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val is
an impressive personality, whose life seems
strangely determined by destiny. His father
was an <i>attach√©</i> of the Spanish embassy to the
Court of St. James when the future Cardinal
was born in 1865. In 1904, at the early age of
thirty-nine, he was advanced from the soutane
violet of the bishop to the mantelletta scarlet
of the cardinal, and after the accession of the
present Pope, Pius X, he was appointed to the
highest office in the Vatican, that of Secretary
of State, the Pope paying him the high tribute
because of his &ldquo;devotion to work, his capability
and absolute self-negation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cardinal Merry del Val has had a wonderful
training of experience and circumstances. At
the early age of twenty-two he was a member
of the papal embassy commissioned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. He was also
appointed a member of the embassy from the
Vatican to attend the funeral of Emperor William
I; and at the jubilee of Francis Joseph,
Emperor of Austria, Cardinal (then Bishop)
Merry del Val was the sole and accredited representative
of the Holy See, as he was also at
the coronation of King Edward. The Spanish
Cardinal is the special trusted counsellor of the
royal family of Spain.</p>

<p>In Rome, Cardinal Merry del Val is an impressive
figure. He is always attended by his
<i><a name="tn148" id="tn148"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'gentilinomo'">gentiluomo</ins></i>, who is gorgeously arrayed in knee
breeches, military hat and sword. This gentleman
in waiting walks behind him on a promenade,
sits in his carriage and stands near him
in all religious ceremonies. His equipage is
well known in the Eternal City,&mdash;a stately
black carriage drawn by two massive black
horses with luxurious flowing manes.</p>

<p>It is freely prophesied in Rome that the Cardinal
secretary is destined to yet exchange the
mantelletta scarlet for the zucchetta white, when
Pius X shall have gone the way of all his predecessors
in the papal chair. He is the Cardinal
especially favored by Austria and Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Although the conflict with France was at first
ascribed to Cardinal Merry del Val, he has of
late been completely exonerated from blame,
even by the French prelates and clergy.</p>

<p>Cardinal Merry del Val represents the most
advanced and progressive thought of the day.
He is an enthusiastic admirer of Marconi and
the marvels of wireless telegraphy; he is an
advocate of telephonic service, electric motors,
electric lights, and of phonographs and typewriters
for the Vatican service. He is a great
linguist, speaking English, French, and German
as well as Spanish, which is his native tongue,
and Italian, which has become second nature.
He is a good Greek scholar and a profound
Latin scholar, and he speaks the ancient Latin
with the fluency and the force of the modern
languages. He is, indeed, a remarkable twentieth-century
personality and one who has
apparently a very interesting life yet to come in
his future.</p>

<p>At the Villa Pamphilia Doria, built by a
former Prince Doria, the largest villa in the
Roman environs and the finest now remaining,
the Cardinal enjoys his game of golf, of which
he is very fond. The Doria family rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the villa magnificent in every respect. Besides
the spacious avenues, woods, fountains, a lake,
and cascades, are various edifices, among which
is one in the form of a triumphal arch, decorated
with ancient statues; the casino of the villa in
which are preserved some ancient marbles and
several pictures; the beautiful circular chapel,
adorned with eight columns of marble and
other stately ornaments. There is a monument
erected by the present Prince Doria to the
memory of the French soldiers who were killed
there during the siege of 1849. From the
terrace of the palace there is a magnificent
view of the environs of Rome, as far as the sea.
In consequence of excavations, some columbaria,
sepulchres, inscriptions, and other relics
have been found, which have attracted much
attention from arch√¶ologists.</p>

<p>It is near these grounds that the &ldquo;Arcadians&rdquo;
still hold their <i>al fresco</i> meetings. The
society dates back to 1690, and the first <i>custos</i>
(whose duty was to open and close the meetings)
was Crescimbeni. The &ldquo;Arcadians&rdquo;
organized themselves to protest against the degeneracy
of Italian poetry that marked the
seventeenth century. To keep their meetings a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
secret from the populace the &ldquo;Arcadians&rdquo; held
their meetings in an open garden on the slope
below San Pietro in Montorio,&mdash;a terrace still
known as &ldquo;Bosco Parrasio degli Arcadi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the enchanting views in Rome is
from the Piazza San Giovanni. One looks far
away past the Coliseum in its ruined grandeur
and the <i>casa</i> where Lucrezia Borgia lived, and
in the near distance is the colossal pile of San
Giovanni di Laterano, its beautiful and impressive
fa√ßade crowned with the statues of the
apostles silhouetted against the western sky. In
the piazza formed by the church, the museums,
and the Baptistery of San Giovanni and the
Scala Santa is one of the most remarkable
obelisks in Rome, ninety-nine feet in height,
formed of red granite and carved with hieroglyphics.
This shaft is placed on a pedestal
which makes it in all some 115 feet in height.
It was placed in 1568 by Sixtus V. The
museums of the San Giovanni are the &ldquo;Museo
Sacro&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Museo Profano,&rdquo;&mdash;the latter
founded by Pope Gregory XVI, and very rich
in sculptures and mosaics. The &ldquo;Museo Sacro&rdquo;
was founded by Pio Nono, and is rich
in the antiquities of the Christian era. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
San Giovanni the visitor finds himself in a vast
interior divided by columns of verd-antique
into three aisles, each of which is as wide as,
and far longer than, the interior of an ordinary
church. Statues fill the niches, and the chapels
and confessionals are all beautifully decorated.
The Corsini Chapel is the richest and was executed
by order of Clement XII, in honor of
St. Andrew Corsini, who is represented in a
rich mosaic painting copied from Guido. Two
sculptured figures, &ldquo;Innocence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Penitence,&rdquo;
stand before the altar, and above is a
relief depicting St. Andrew protecting the Florentine
army at the battle of Anghiari.</p>

<p>The tomb of Pope Clement XII (who himself
belonged to the Corsini family and who was an
uncle of Cardinal Corsini) is in a niche between
two columns of porphyry, and there is a bronze
statue of the Pope. On the opposite side is a
statue of Cardinal Corsini, and in the crypt
below are tombs of the Corsini family. On the
altar&mdash;always lighted&mdash;is a &ldquo;Pieta&rdquo; by Bernini,
of which the face of the Christ is very
beautiful.</p>

<p>Near the centre of the Basilica is a rich tabernacle
of precious stones, defined by four col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>umns
of <i>verde antico</i>, and it is said that the
heads of St. Peter and St. Paul are preserved
here. The table upon which Christ
celebrated the Last Supper is placed here,
above the altar of the Holy Sacrament, a
sacred relic that thrills the visitors. In one
chapel is a curious and grotesque group of
sculpture,&mdash;a skeleton holding up a medallion
portrait, while an angel with outstretched
wings hovers over it.</p>

<p>San Giovanni has the reputation of being
absolutely the coldest church in all Rome,
which&mdash;it is needless to remark&mdash;means a
great deal, for they all in winter have the temperature
of the arctic regions. In all these
great churches there is never any heat; no
apparatus for heating has ever been introduced,
and the twentieth century finds them just as
cold as they were in the centuries of a thousand
years ago. This colossal Basilica is
considered the most important church in the
world, as it is the cathedral of the Pontiff. It
was founded in the third century by Constantine,
destroyed by fire in 1308, and rebuilt by
Pope Clement V, and every succeeding Pope
has added to it. The fa√ßade is of travertine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
with four gigantic columns and six pilasters,
and the cornice is decorated with colossal figures
of Jesus and a number of the saints. There are
five balconies, the middle one being always used
for papal benedictions. In the portico is the
colossal statue of Constantine the Great.
Within the columns are of <i>verde antico</i>; the
ceiling was designed by Michael Angelo; the
interior is very rich in sculpture, and there are
some fine paintings and the chapels are most
beautiful, one of them containing a tabernacle
comprised wholly of precious stones. Above
the altar of the Holy Sacrament the table upon
which Christ celebrated the Last Supper with
the disciples is preserved. It is wonderful to
look upon this most sacred and significant
relic.</p>

<p>It is in this church that the tomb of Leo
XIII has been constructed by the eminent
Italian sculptor, Tadolini, opposite the tomb of
Innocent III. The work was completed in the
spring of 1907, the design being a life-size portrait
statue of the Pope with two figures, one on
either side, representing the church and the
workman-pilgrim, forming part of the group.
This is one of the most memorable monu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>ments
of all Rome, and the tomb of the great
Leo XIII will form a new shrine for Christian
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Included in the group of structures that form
the great Basilica of San Giovanni is the Scala
Santa, which offers a strange picture whenever
one approaches it. These twenty-eight marble
steps that belonged to Pilate&rsquo;s house in Jerusalem
are said to have been once trodden by
Jesus and may be ascended only on one&rsquo;s knees.
At no hour of the day can one visit the Scala
Santa without finding the most motley and
incongruous throng thus ascending, pausing on
each step for meditation and prayer. These
stairs were transported from Jerusalem to
Rome under the auspices of St. Helena, the
Empress, about 326 A.D., and in 1589 they were
placed by Pope Sixtus V in this portico built
for them with a chapel at the top of the stairs
called the &ldquo;Sancta Sanctorum,&rdquo; formerly the
private chapel of the Popes. In this sanctuary
is preserved a wonderful portrait of the Saviour,
painted on wood, which is said to have been
partly the work of St. Luke but finished by
unseen hands. The legend runs that St. Luke
prepared to undertake the work by three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&rsquo;
fasting and prayer, and that, having drawn it
in outline, the painting was done by angelic
ministry, the colors being filled in by invisible
hands. In ancient times&mdash;the custom being
abolished by Pius V in 1566&mdash;this picture was
borne through Rome on the Feast of the Assumption
and the bearer halted with it in the
Forum, when the &ldquo;Kyrie Eleison&rdquo; would be
chanted by hundreds of voices.</p>

<p>Myth and legend invest every turn and footfall
of the Eternal City, and there are few that
are not founded on what the church has always
called supernatural manifestations, but which
the new age is learning to recognize as occurrences
under natural law.</p>

<p>The story of Luther&rsquo;s ascent of the Scala
Santa is thus told:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Brother Martin Luther went to accomplish
the ascent of the Scala Santa&mdash;the Holy Staircase&mdash;which
once, they say, formed part of
Pilate&rsquo;s house. He slowly mounted step after
step of the hard stone, worn into hollows by
the knees of penitents and pilgrims. Patiently
he crept halfway up the staircase, when he
suddenly stood erect, lifted his face heavenward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and in another moment turned and walked
slowly down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said that as he was toiling up a voice as
if from heaven spoke to him and said, &lsquo;The
just shall live by faith.&rsquo; He awoke as if from
a nightmare, restored to himself. He dared not
creep up another step; but rising from his knees
he stood upright like a man suddenly loosed
from bonds and fetters, and with the firm step
of a free man he descended the staircase and
walked from the place.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The entire legendary as well as sacred history
is almost made up of instances of the interpenetration
of the two worlds; the response of
those in the spiritual world to the needs of those
in the natural world. Pope Paschal recorded
that he fell asleep in his chair at St. Peter&rsquo;s
(somewhere about 8.20 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>) with a prayer on
his lips that he might find the burial place of
St. Cecilia, and in his dream she appeared to
him and showed him the spot where her body
lay, in the catacombs of Calixtus. The next
day he went to the spot and found all as had
been revealed to him. The miraculous preservation
of St. Agnes is familiar to all students of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
legendary art. Throughout all Rome, shrine
and niche and sculpture, picture, monument,
arch and column, speak perpetually of some
interposition of unseen forces with events and
circumstances in this part of life. The Eternal
City in its rich and poetic symbolism is one
great object lesson of the interblending of the
two worlds, the natural and the spiritual.
The first stage regarding all this marvellous
panorama was entire and unquestioning acceptance;
the succeeding stage was doubt, disbelief;
the third, into which we are now entering,
is that of an enlightened understanding and a
growing knowledge and grasp of the laws under
which these special interpositions and interventions
occur.</p>

<p>For that &ldquo;according to thy faith be it unto
thee,&rdquo; is as true now in the twentieth century
as it was in the first. The one central truth
that is the very foundation of all religious
philosophy is the continuity of life and the persistence
of intercourse and communion, spirit
to spirit, across the gulf we call death. The
evidences of this truth have been always in the
world. The earliest records of the Bible are
replete with them. The gospels of the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Testament record an unbroken succession of
occurrences and of testimony to this interpenetration
of life in the Unseen with that in the
Seen. Secular history is full of its narrations
of instances of clairvoyance, clairaudience, and
of communications in a variety of ways; and the
sacred and legendary art of Rome, largely
founded on story and myth and legend, when
seen in the light of latter-day science is judged
anew, and the literal truth of much that has
before been considered purely legendary is revealed
and realized. One reads new meanings
into Rome when testing it by this consciousness.
It is a city of spiritual symbolism. It is a great
object lesson extending over all the centuries.
Making due allowance for the distortion and
exaggeration of ages of testimony, there yet
remains a residuum indisputable. The Past
and the Present both teem with record and
incident and experience proving that life is
twofold, even now and here; that all the motives
and acts of the life which we see are variously
incited, modified, strengthened, or annulled by
those in the realm of the Unseen.</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption noi"><small>ENTRANCE TO VILLA PAMPHILIA-DORIA, ROME</small></p>
</div>

<p>The intelligent recognition of this truth
changes the entire conduct of life. It entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
alters the point of view. It extends the horizon
line infinitely. Instead of conceiving of life as
a whole, as comprised between the cradle and
the grave, it will be regarded in its larger and
truer scope as a series of experiences and
achievements, infinite in length and in their possibilities
and unbroken by the change we call
death. This will impart to humanity a new
motor spring in that greater hope which puts
man in a working mood, which makes him believe
in the value of that which he undertakes,
which encourages him to press on amid all
difficulties and against all obstacles. Increasing
hope, all activity is proportionately increased.
It was an event of incalculable importance to
the progress of humanity when the swift communication
by cable was established between
America and Europe. It is one of infinitely
greater importance to establish the truth and
enlarge the possibility of direct communication
with the world of higher forces and larger attainment
and scope than our own. This communication
exists and has always existed, but
it has been regarded as myth and legend and
phenomenon rather than as a fact of nature
whose laws were to be ascertained and understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
It must be made clear as an absolute
scientific demonstration that the change of form
by the process we call death does not put an
end to intelligent and rational intercourse, but
that, indeed, instead of setting up a barrier, it
removes barriers and renders mutual comprehension
far clearer and more direct than before.
This realization alters the entire perspective of
life, and is the new Glad Tidings of great joy.</p>

<p>It is something of all this that the Eternal
City suggests to one as he makes his pilgrimages
to shrine and cloister and chapel and Basilica.
The mighty Past is eloquent with a thousand
voices, and they blend into a choral harmony
of promise and prophecy for the nobler future
of humanity.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Scala Santa, on either
side, are statues of Christ and Judas, and of
Christ and Pilate, very interesting groups by
<a name="tn161" id="tn161"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Jacomletti'">Jacometti</ins>, and there is also a kneeling statue
of Pio Nono.</p>

<p>The statue of Judas is considered one of the
most notable of the late modern Italian sculpture.</p>

<p>The Rome of to-day is in strange contrast
even to the city that Page and Hawthorne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
knew, in the comparatively recent past; and
the Rome of the ancients is traced only in the
churches and the ruins. It is a <i>mot</i> that one
hears every language spoken in Rome, except
the Italian! So largely has the Seven-hilled
City become the pleasure ground of foreign
residents. The contrast between the ordinary
breakfast-table talk in Rome and in&mdash;Boston,
for instance, or Washington, is amusing. In
the Puritan capital it usually includes the topic
of weather predictions and the news in the
morning paper, with whatever other of local or
personal matters of interest. In Washington,
where the very actors and the events that make
the nation&rsquo;s history are fairly before one&rsquo;s
eyes, the breakfast-table conversation is apt to
turn on matters that have not yet got into the
papers,&mdash;the evening session of the previous
night, perhaps, when too long prolonged under
the vast dome to admit of its having been noted
in the morning press. But in Rome the breakfast-table
talk is apt to be of the new excavations
just taken from the bed of the Tiber;
the question as to whether the head of St. Paul
could have touched (at the tragic scene of his
execution) at three places so far apart as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
tri-fontanes; or a discussion of the marvellous
freshness of the mosaics in the interior of the
Palace of the C√¶sars; or, again, of the last
night&rsquo;s balls or dinners, and matters most
frankly <i>mondaine</i>, and of contemporary life.</p>

<p>The American Embassy, whose location depends
on the individual choice of the Ambassador
of the time, is now in the old Palazzo
del Drago on the corner of the Via Venti Settembre
and the Via <a name="tn163a" id="tn163a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'dell'">delle</ins> Quattro Fontane. The
street floor, like all the old palaces, is not used
for living purposes. The <a name="tn163b" id="tn163b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'portere'">portiere</ins>, the guards,
the corridors, and approaches to the staircases
monopolize this space. The piano nobile is
the residence of the beautiful and lovely Principessa
d&rsquo;Antuni, the youthful widow of the
Principe who was himself a grandson of Marie
Christine, the Queen of Spain. The young
Princess who was married to him at the age of
seventeen, ten years ago, is left with three little
children, of whom the only daughter bears the
name of her great-grandmother, the Spanish
Queen. Perfectly at home in all the romance
languages, an accomplished musician, a thinker,
a scholar, a student, a lovely figure in life, a
beautiful and sympathetic friend is the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
d&rsquo;Antuni. She is &ldquo;of a simplicity,&rdquo; as they
say in Italy, investing the dignity of her rank
with indescribable grace and sweetness. The
two long flights of stairs that lead up to the
secundo piano in the Palazzo del Drago&mdash;the
floor occupied by the American Embassy&mdash;have
at least a hundred steps to each staircase,
yet so broad and easy of ascent as hardly to
fatigue one. These flights are carpeted in
glowing red, while along the wall are niches in
each of which stands an old statue, making the
ascent of the guest seem a classic progress.</p>

<p>The Palazzo del Drago has an elevator, but
elevator service in Rome is a thing apart,
something considered quite too good for human
nature&rsquo;s daily food, and the slight power is
far too little to permit any number of people
to be accommodated, so on any ceremonial
occasion the elevator is closed and the guests
walk up the two long flights. The total lack
of any mastery of mechanical conditions in
Italy is very curious.</p>

<p>The grand ball given at the American Embassy
just before Ash Wednesday in the winter
of 1907 was a very pretty affair. Up the rose-red
carpeted stairs the guests walked, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
statues looking silently on, but apparently there
was no Galatea to step down from her niche
and join the happy throng. In the antechamber
each guest was asked to write his name in the
large autograph books kept for that purpose,
and then, passing on, was received by the
Ambassador and Ambassadress in the first of
the splendid series of salons thrown open for
the occasion. At this time it was Mr. and
Mrs. Henry White who represented the United
States, and won the hearts of all Rome as well,
and assisted by their charming daughter, Miss
Muriel White, they made this ball an affair to
leave its lovely pictures in memory. The scenic
setting of an old Roman palace captivates the
stranger. It may not impress him as especially
comfortable, but it is certainly picturesque, and
who would not prefer&mdash;at least for the &ldquo;one
night only&rdquo; of the traditional <i>prima donna</i>
announcements&mdash;the pictorially picturesque
and magnificent to the merely comfortable?
The lofty ceilings, painted by artists who have
long since vanished from mortal sight, make
it impossible to attain the temperature that the
American regards as essential to his terrestrial
well-being, and as the only sources of heat were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the open fireplaces the guests hovered around
these and their radii of comfortable warmth
were limited. In one salon there was one
especially beautiful effect of a great jar of white
lilacs placed before a vast mirror at sufficient
distance to give the mirror reflection an individuality
as a thing apart, and the effect was that
of a very garden of paradise. The music was
fascinating, the decorations all in good taste,
and the occasion was most brilliant,&mdash;<i>tr√®s
charmante</i> indeed. The American ambassadress
was ablaze with her famous diamonds,
her corsage being literally covered with them,
and her coiffure adorned with a coronet, but the
temperature soon forced the ambassadress to
partially eclipse her splendor with the little ermine
shoulder cape that is an indispensable article
for evening dress in Rome. The temperature
does not admit the possibility of <i>d√©collet√©</i> gowns
without some protection, when these resplendent
glittering robes that seem woven of the stars
are worn. Among the more distinguished
guests, aside from the <i>corps diplomatique</i> and
the titled nobility of Rome and visiting foreigners,
were M. Carolus Duran, the celebrated
portrait artist of Paris, and among other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
interesting people were Miss Elise Emmons of
Leamington, England, a grand-niece of Charlotte
Cushman. M. Carolus Duran was very magnificent,
his breast covered with jewelled orders
and decorations from the various societies,
academies, and governments that have honored
him. He is a short man and has grown quite
stout, but he carries himself with inimitable
grace and dignity, and in his luminous eyes one
still surprises that far-away look which Sargent
so wonderfully caught in his portrait of the
great French artist, painted in his earlier life.</p>

<p>The number of spacious salons with their
easy-chairs and sofas enabled all guests who
desired to ensconce themselves luxuriously to
do so, and watch the glittering scene. The
supper room and the salon for dancing were
not more alluring than the salons wherein one
could study this brilliant throng of diplomates,
titled nobility, distinguished artists, social celebrities,
and those who were, in various ways,
each <i>persona grata</i> in Rome. Among those at
this particular festivity were the American novelist,
Frank Hamilton Spearman, with Mrs. Spearman.
In late American fiction Mr. Spearman
has made for himself a distinctive place as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
novelist whose artistic eye has discerned the
romance in the new phases of life created by
the extensive systems of mountain railroading,
and the great irrigation schemes of the far West,
which have not only opened up new territory,
but have called into evidence new combinations
of the qualities most potent in human life,&mdash;love,
sacrifice, heroism, devotion to duty, and
tragedy and comedy as well. In his novels,
&ldquo;The Daughter of a Magnate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whispering
Smith,&rdquo; in such vivid and delightful short
stories as &ldquo;The Ghost at Point of Rocks,&rdquo;
which appeared in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for
August of 1907, Mr. Spearman has dramatized
the pathos, the wit, the vast and marvellous
spirit of enterprise, the desolation of isolated
regions, the all-pervading potency and one may
almost say intimacy of modern life made possible
by the Arabian Nights&rsquo; dream of wireless
telegraphy, &ldquo;soaring&rdquo; cars, long-distance telephoning,
and lightning express train service
in cars that climb the mountains beyond the
clouds, or dash through tunnels with ten thousand
feet of mountains above them. Mr. Spearman
is the novelist <i>par excellence</i> of this intense
<i>vie modernit√©</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>On Washington&rsquo;s Birthday, again, the stately
salons of the American Embassy in the old
Palazzo del Drago were well filled from four to
six with an assemblage which expressed its
patriotism and devotion to Washington by appearing
in its most faultless raiment and in an
apparent appreciation of the refreshment tables,
from which cake and ices, tea and various other
delicacies, were served.</p>

<p>The informal weekly receptions at the Embassy
are always delightful, and the dinners
and ceremonial entertainments are given with
that faultless grace which characterizes the
American ambassadress.</p>

<p>The American consulate is always a charming
centre in Rome, and in the present residence
of Consul-General and Mrs. De Castro, who
have domiciled themselves on a lofty floor of a
palace in the Via Venti Settembre, commanding
beautiful views that make a picture of every
window, the consulate is one of the favorite
social centres for Americans and other nationalities
as well, who enjoy the charming welcome
of Mrs. De Castro.</p>

<p>Professor and Mrs. Jesse Benedict Carter, in
their lovely home in the Via Gregoriana, add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
another to the pleasant American centres in the
Eternal City, Professor Carter having succeeded
Professor Norton as the principal of the American
Classical School.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elihu Vedder, assisted by her accomplished
daughter, Miss Anita Vedder, has a
pretty fashion of receiving weekly in Mr.
Vedder&rsquo;s studio in the Via Flaminia, and these
Saturday receptions at the Vedders&rsquo; are a feature
of social life in Rome which are greatly
sought. The distinguished artist reserves these
afternoons for leisurely conversation, and pictures
and sketches are enjoyed the more that
they may be enjoyed in the presence of their
creator. Miss Vedder has called to life again
the almost lost art of tapestry, and her productions
of wonderful beauty are considered as
among the most desirable in modern decorative
art. Among these tapestries are &ldquo;The
Lover&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Salome Dancing before
Herod,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Annunciation,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Legend of
the Unicorn,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lovers&rsquo; Picnic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Lovers.&rdquo; The tapestries were painted in Rome
and in the Vedder villa, <i>Torre <a name="tn170" id="tn170"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Quatro'">Quattro</ins> Venti</i>
on Capri, where the artist and his wife and
daughter pass their summers. The established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
English Church has two chapels in Rome, one
the Holy Trinity, of which Rev. Dr. Baldwin
is the rector, and the other English chapel in
Via del Babuino has for its chaplain Rev. Dr.
Nutcombe Oxenham, whose ministry is one of
the most helpful factors in Rome. Dr. and
Mrs. Oxenham occupy a charming apartment
in the Piazza del Popolo, the most picturesque
piazza in Rome, with the terraced Pincion hillside
crowned by the Villa di Medici on one
side, and the &ldquo;twin churches&rdquo; on another; and
the beautiful salon of Mrs. Oxenham, with its
wealth of books and classic engravings and gems
of pictures, is one of the homelike interiors in
Rome. Mr. and Mrs. Oxenham receive on
Wednesdays, and an hour with them and their
guests is always a privileged one.</p>

<p>The work of this church, largely through the
active co-operation of Mrs. Oxenham, extends
into wide charities which are without discrimination
as to sect or race,&mdash;the only consideration
being the human need to be met in the
name of Him whose care and love are for each
and all.</p>

<p>Among the delightful hostesses of Rome is
the American wife of <a name="tn171" id="tn171"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Caviliere'">Cavaliere</ins> Cortesi, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Italian man of letters, and in their apartment,
in one of the notable palaces in the Corso, some
of the most brilliant musicals and receptions
are given, the &ldquo;All&rsquo;Illustrissima Signora&rdquo; being
assisted in the informal serving of tea by the
two little fairy daughters, Annunziata and
Elizabetta, whose childish loveliness lingers
with the <i>habitu√©s</i> of this pleasant home.</p>

<p>In the Palazzo Senni, in the old part of Rome,
looking out on Castel San Angelo and the
Ponte d&rsquo;Angelo, across to the dome of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, the Listers had their home; and though
Mrs. Lister, one of the most distinguished
English ladies of Rome, has gone on into the
fairer world beyond, her daughter, Miss Roma
Lister, sustains the charming hospitalities for
which her mother was famous. Her salons on
the piano nobile of the palace are rich in souvenirs
and rare objects of art. Mrs. Lister,
who was of a noted English house, was evidently
a favorite with Queen Victoria and the royal
family; and her marriage gifts included two
drawings by the Queen, both autographed, and
a crayon portrait of the Empress Frederick
with autographic inscription to Mrs. Lister.
Another personal gift was a portrait of Cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Newman, with his autograph. A bust of Lady
Paget of Florence, the widow of Sir Augustus
Paget, formerly the English Ambassador to
Italy, is another of the interesting treasures
which include, indeed, gifts and offerings from
a large number of those eminent in state, in
art, in literature, or in the church. The gracious
hospitality of Miss Lister is dispensed to groups
of cosmopolitan guests, and her dinners and
other entertainments are among the most brilliant
in Rome.</p>

<p>The Eternal City is not as hospitable to
various phases of modern thought as is Florence,
in which Theosophy, Christian Science, and
psychic investigation flourish with rapidly increasing
ardor; but Rome has a Theosophical
Society, among whose leaders is the Baroness
Rosenkrans, the mother of the distinguished
young Danish novelist, and the aunt of Miss
Roma Lister. The society has its rooms in the
very heart of old Rome, and holds weekly meetings,
often with an English lecturer as the speaker
of the hour. A Theosophical library, in both
English and Italian, is easily accessible, and the
meetings are conducted in either language as
it chances at the time. The accession of Annie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Besant to the presidency of the Theosophical
Society, succeeding Colonel Olcott, whose death
occurred early in 1907, was most satisfactory
to the Roman members. Mrs. Besant is one
of the most remarkable women of the day. She
is in no sense allied with any fads or freaks;
she is essentially a woman of scholarship and
poise, of genuine grasp of significant thought
and of brilliant eloquence. Theosophy, rightly
interpreted, is in no sense antagonistic, but,
rather, supplemental to Christianity. It offers
the intellectual explanation&mdash;the details, so
to speak&mdash;of the great spiritual truths of the
Bible.</p>

<p>Rome seems fairly on its way to become an
English-speaking city, so numerous are the
Americans and English who throng to Rome
in the winter.</p>

<p>There are now at least a dozen large new
hotels on the scale of the best modern hotels in
New York and Paris, beside the multitude of
the older ones which are comfortable and retain
all their popularity; yet this increase in accommodation
does not equal the increase in demand.
In February the tide of travel sets in toward
Rome, and from that date until after Easter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
every nook and niche are filled to overflowing.
The demand for apartments in Rome is
greater than the supply, although the city is
being constantly extended and new buildings
are rapidly being erected. It would seem as if,
with the present increasingly large number of
Americans and English, it might be an admirable
financial enterprise for capitalists to come and
build comfortable modern apartment hotels.
There seems to be no adequate reason why, in
this age, people should be compelled to live in
these gloomy, dreary, cold, old stone palaces,
without elevator service and with no adequate
heating, lighting, and running-water facilities.
There would seem to be no conceivable reason
why these conveniences should not be at hand
in Rome as well as in New York. As for the
climate, with warm houses to live in, it would
be charmingly comfortable, for the deadly cold
is not in the temperature out of doors, but only
in the interiors. One is warm in the sunshine
in the streets, when he is fairly frozen in the
house. Mentioning this, however, with wonder
that some enterprising American did not begin
such building operations, a friend who has lived
for sixteen years in Rome replied that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Italians would never permit it; that no foreigner
is allowed to come in here and initiate business
operations. And the Italians continue building
after the old and clumsy fashion of five hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>Italy has a curiously pervasive and general
suspicion of any latter-day comfort. The new
apartment houses of from four to seven stories
are largely without any elevator; if there is one
it usually only ascends about halfway, and it is
so clumsy and slow in its methods, so poorly
supported by power, that half the time it does
not run at all. The streets of Rome are paved
with rough stones; the sidewalks are very narrow;
the lighting is inadequate. Bathrooms are
rare and insufficient in number, and all interior
lighting and heating arrangements lack much
that is desirable according to American ideas
of comfort.</p>

<p>Still the Eternal City is so impressive in and
of itself that sunshine or storm, comfort or the
reverse, can hardly affect one&rsquo;s intensity of joy
and wonder and mysterious, unanalyzable rapture
in it. The twentieth-century Rome is a
very different affair from the Rome on which
Hawthorne entered one dark, cold, stormy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
winter night more than half a century ago. In
the best modern hotels one may be as comfortable
as he likes, with all the fascinations of
life added besides. No wonder that Rome is
one of the great winter centres, with some of the
most interesting people in the world always to
be found under the spell of its enchantment.</p>

<p>The Rome of to-day is a curious mixture of
ruins and of modern buildings which are neither
modern nor medi√¶val in their structure, but
many of which combine the most picturesque
features of the latter with the latest beauty of
French and American architectural art. The
classic buildings are now largely in unpleasant
surroundings; as, for instance, the Pantheon,
which is surrounded by a fish market, with unspeakable
odors and other repulsive features.
&ldquo;But the portico, with its sixteen Corinthian
columns, is forever majestic; the interior, a vast
circular cell surmounted by a dome through
which alone it is lighted, there being no windows
in the walls, is massive and grim, but the
magical illumination, the eye constantly revealing
the sky above, gives it wonderful beauty.
Over the outer portals is the inscription of its
erection by Agrippa twenty-seven years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Christ, so it has stood for nearly two thousand
years. Colossal statues of Augustus and Agrippa
fill niches. In diameter the interior of the
Pantheon is one hundred and thirty-two feet,
and it is the same in height, which insures the
singularly harmonious proportions. The tribune
of the High-Altar is cut in the thickness of the
wall in the form of a semicircle, and is ornamented,
like the door, with four pilasters and
two columns of violet marble. The six chapels
are also cut in the wall and ornamented by two
columns and two pilasters. The columns and
the pilasters support the beautiful cornice of
white marble; the frieze is of porphyry, and
goes round the whole temple. Above this order
there is a species of attic with fourteen niches,
and the great cornice from which rises the
majestic dome. Eight other niches are between
the chapels, and these are also with a pediment
supported by two Corinthian columns. They
are now converted into altars. In this temple
are buried several artists, among whom are
Raphael, Giovanni da Udine, Baldassare
Peruzzi, and Annibale <a name="tn178" id="tn178"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Caracci'">Carracci</ins>. Raphael is
buried beneath the base of the statue called
la Madonna del Sasso, sculptured by Lorenzetti.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
This church is, however, without paintings or
sculptures of much interest. Victor Emmanuel
was entombed here on the 20th of January,
1878, and King Umberto on the 9th of August,
1900.&rdquo; One of the imposing ceremonies of
Rome is that always celebrated in the Pantheon
on March 14, in memory of King Umberto
Primo.</p>

<p>A grand catafalque, surmounted by the royal
crown, and surrounded by tall candelabra with
wax candles, is erected in the centre of the
temple, draped with black velvet and gold lace,
and lighted with electric lamps. The mass is
for a chorus of voices only. All the civil and
military authorities, the state dignitaries, and
the <i>corps diplomatique</i> to the court of Italy are
present. The troops, in full dress uniform, file
in the Piazza of the Collegio Romano, Via Pi√®
di Marmo, and the Piazza della Minerva, enclosing
thus a large square in the Piazza del
Pantheon. The spectacle is one of the most
imposing of all Roman ceremonies.</p>

<p>The King, and Queen Elena, and the Dowager
Queen Margherita, accompanied by their respective
civil and military households, assist at
the requiem mass celebrated in the Pantheon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and at a commemoration service, on the same
day, in the Royal Chapel of the Sudario, where
also assemble the ladies and gentlemen of the
Order of the Annunziata.</p>

<p>On the same morning the feast of St. Gregory,
Pope and Doctor of the church, is celebrated
at his church on the C√¶lian Hill. He was born
of a noble family, and was Prefect of Rome in
573. Pope Pelagius II made him regionary
deacon of Rome, and sent him as legate to
Constantinople in 578, where he remained till
the death of Pelagius, when he was elected
Pope (590). He introduced the Gregorian chant.
His first great act was to send St. Augustine to
convert the Saxons of England to the Christian
faith. An inscription in the Church of San
Gregorio Magno states that St. Augustine was
educated in the abbey which was erected on the
site of the present church by Gregory, and that
many early archbishops of York and Canterbury
were also educated there. It was on the
steps of this church that Augustine and his
forty monks took leave of Gregory, when setting
out for England. He died in 604, after a pontificate
of thirteen years and six months. He was
buried in the portico of the Vatican Basilica,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and his body lies under the altar dedicated to
him in this same church. His church, on the
C√¶lian Hill, was built on the site of the monastery
founded by him. In the chapel of the
triclinium, near the church, the table on which
he served the poor is shown. Near the church
also is seen his cell, where his marble chair and
one of his arms are exhibited.</p>

<p>During the Lenten season of 1907 one of the
privileges of Rome was to hear the sermons of
Monsignor Vaughn, in the English Catholic
Church of San Silvestre. Monsignor Vaughn
is the private chaplain of the Pope. His discourses
attracted increasing throngs of both
Catholic and Protestant hearers. This celebrated
prelate is a brother of the late English
Cardinal. He is a man of great distinction of
presence, of beautiful voice and fascination of
manner. One discourse had for its theme the
joys of the life that is to come. The spiritual
body, he said, has many qualities not pertaining
to the physical body. It is immured from all
disease and accidents; it is subtle and can pass
through any substance which is (apparently)
solid to us, as, for instance, when Jesus appeared
in the midst of his disciples, &ldquo;the doors being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
shut.&rdquo; It is not a clog on the soul, continued
Monsignor Vaughn; the spiritual body is the
vehicle of the soul and can waft its way through
the air; it can walk the air as the physical body
walks the earth. It is not&mdash;as is the physical
body&mdash;the prison of the soul, but the companion
of the soul. This is all a very enlightened
presentation of spiritual truth, and it is little
wonder that such preaching attracts large congregations.
Holy Week in Rome bears little
resemblance now to that of the past. The
Pope is not visible in any of the ceremonials
in any of the churches; and the impressiveness
of former Catholic ceremonials is greatly lessened.
Indeed, with the passing of the temporal
power of the Pope, the picturesqueness of Rome
largely vanished.</p>

<p>Not, assuredly, from any lack of reverence
for the colossal cathedral of St. Peter&rsquo;s is that
Basilica a resort for Sunday afternoons; it
suggests a social reunion, where every one
goes, listens as he will to the music of the
Papal choir in the Chapel of the Sacrament,
and strolls about the vast interior where the
promenade of the multitude does not yet disturb
in the least the vesper service in the chapel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Here one meets everybody; the general news of
the day is exchanged; greeting and salutation
and pleasant little conversational interludes
mark the afternoon, while the sun sinks behind
the splendid pile of the Palazzo Vaticano, and
the golden light through the window of the
tribune fades into dusk. Can one ever lose out
of memory the indescribable charm of this
leisurely sauntering, in social enjoyment, in
the wonderful interior of St. Peter&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>In the way of the regulation sight-seeing the
visitor to Rome compasses most of his duty in
this respect on his initial sojourn and goes the
rounds that no one ever need dream of repeating.
Once for all the visitor to Rome goes
down into the Catacombs; makes his appallingly
hard journey over Castel San Angelo, into its
cells and dungeons, and to the colossal salon
in which is Hadrian&rsquo;s tomb; once for a lifetime
he climbs St. Peter&rsquo;s dome; drives out to old
St. Agnes and descends into the crypt; visits
the Church of the Capucines and beholds the
ghastly spectacle of the monks&rsquo; skulls; drives
in the Appian Way; visits the Palace of the
C√¶sars, the Baths of Caracalla&mdash;a mass of
ruins; the Forum; the Temples of Vesta and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Isis; the Coliseum, and the classic old Pantheon.
These form a kind of skeleton for the regulation
sight-seeing of the Eternal City; things which,
once done, are checked off with the feeling that
the entire duty of the tourist has been fulfilled,
and that, henceforth in Rome, there is laid up
for him the crown of enjoyment, if not rejoicing;
that he may go again and again to
study the marvellous treasures of the Vatican
galleries, the masterpieces of art in the Raphael
stanze in the Vatican, the interesting pictures
and sculpture in the many rich churches and
galleries. The deadly chill of most of these
galleries and churches in the winter is beyond
words to describe. It is as if the gloom and
chill and darkness of a thousand centuries were
there concentrated.</p>

<p>One of the regulation places for the devout
sight-seer, who feels responsible to his conscience
for improving his privileges, is the Museo
Nazionale, or the Tiberine Museum, a large
proportion of whose treasures have been excavated
in making the new embankments of
the Tiber. It is located on the site of the Baths
of Diocletian, the great ruins of which surround
it in the most uncanny way. Built around a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
large court, the salons of the museum are
entered from the inner cloisters. In the centre
of the court is a fountain, and around it are
antique fragments of statues, columns, and
statuettes found in many places. The famous
Ludovisi collection of antique statuary is now
permanently placed in this museum,&mdash;a collection
that includes the &ldquo;Ludovisi Mars;&rdquo; <a name="tn185" id="tn185"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: opening quote missing">&ldquo;Hercules,&rdquo;</ins>
with a cornucopia; the &ldquo;Hermes of
Theseus,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Discobolus Hermes;&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Venus of Gnidus&rdquo; as copied by Praxiteles;
the &ldquo;Dying Medusa;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Ludovisi Juno,&rdquo;
which Winckelmann declares to be the finest
head of Juno extant, a Greek work of the
fourth century; a &ldquo;Cupid and Psyche;&rdquo; the
two &ldquo;Muses of Astronomy&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Epic
Poetry,&rdquo; &ldquo;Urania and Calliope;&rdquo; &ldquo;an Antoninus;&rdquo;
the largest sarcophagus known; a
&ldquo;Tragic Mask&rdquo; (colossal) in rosso antico; a
bust of &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius&rdquo; in bronze, and
many other priceless works.</p>

<p>The splendor of scenic setting for art in the
magnificent salons of the Casino Borghese has
never been surpassed. They are, perhaps, the
most impressive of any Roman interior, with
lofty, splendidly decorated ceilings and walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
where recess and niche hold priceless sculptures.
The splendor of these salons, indeed, quite
exceeds description. In the principal one is
a group on one wall&mdash;a colossal relief&mdash;representing
Marcus Curtius plunging into the gulf
in the Forum. There are busts of the twelve
C√¶sars; there are busts of all the Roman Emperors,
with alabaster draperies, placed on
pedestals of red granite. There are Bernini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Apollo and Daphne;&rdquo; Canova&rsquo;s celebrated
statue of Princess Pauline Borghese (the sister
of Napoleon I); Bernini&rsquo;s &ldquo;David&rdquo; and &ldquo;√Üneas
and Anchises;&rdquo; Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faun;&rdquo; &ldquo;Diana,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Isis,&rdquo; &ldquo;Juno,&rdquo; and many other celebrated
classic statues. All the great paintings
which were formerly in the Palazzo Borghese&mdash;over
six hundred in all&mdash;are now in
this casino. The great work in this collection
is Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Entombment of Christ,&rdquo; painted
in his twenty-fourth year. Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Divine
and Human Love;&rdquo; Raphael&rsquo;s portrait of
&ldquo;C√¶sar Borgia;&rdquo; Correggio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dana√´;&rdquo; Domenichino&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cum√¶an Sibyl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Diana;&rdquo;
Peruzzi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Venus Leaving the Bath;&rdquo; Van
Dyck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crucifixion;&rdquo; Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Venus and
Cupid;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Annunciation,&rdquo; by Paul Veronese;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Vasari&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia;&rdquo; Botticelli&rsquo;s &ldquo;Holy
Family and Angels;&rdquo; Van Dyck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Entombment;&rdquo;
Carlo Dolce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mater Dolorosa,&rdquo; and
Sassoferrato&rsquo;s &ldquo;Three Ages of Man&rdquo; are among
the great masterpieces in this museum.</p>

<p>The Villa Borghese (by which is meant the
park) is some three miles in extent, and was
laid out some two hundred years ago by Cardinal
Borghese. As recently as 1902 it was purchased
by the government for three million francs, and
its official name is now &ldquo;Villa Comunale Umberto
Primo.&rdquo; These grounds contain fountains,
antique statues, tablets, small temples
and many inscriptions, with statues of √Üsculapius
and Apollo, and an Egyptian gateway.
They are open all day to every one freely and
are one of the great attractions of Rome.</p>

<p>The great palaces of Rome are of later date
than those of Florence. There are some eighty
principal ones, of which the Palazzos Veneziano,
Farnese, Doria, Barberini, Colonna,
and the Rospigliosi (containing Guido&rsquo;s famous
&ldquo;Aurora&rdquo;) are the most important.
The Farnesina Palace contains some of the
most interesting pictures in Rome, and the
traditions of the residence of Agostino Chigi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
during the pontificate of Leo X, are still found
in Rome,&mdash;traditions of the lavish magnificence
of the entertainments given here to the
Pope and the Cardinals.</p>

<p>The Monte Pincio is the famous drive of
Roman society, and the promenade around the
brow of the hill offers one of the most enchanting
views of the world. Near the Trinit√† di
Monti stands the historic Villa Medici, the
French Academy of which the great Carolus
Duran is now the director. The view across
the valley in which lies the Piazza di Spagna, the
river to St. Peter&rsquo;s, from the Villa Medici, is
one of the finest in Rome.</p>

<p>The architecture of the garden fa√ßade is
attributed to Michael Angelo. These gardens
have a circuit of more than a mile, laid out in
the formal rectangles and densely bordered walks
of the Italian custom. All manner of old fragments
of sculpture are scattered through them,&mdash;a
torso, a broken bust, a ruined statue, an
old and partly broken fountain,&mdash;and entablatures
and reliefs are seen in the walls on every
hand. No sound of the city ever penetrates
into this dense foliage which secludes the
gardens of the famous Villa Medici.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the features of Roman life is the
fashionable drive on Monte Pincio in the late
afternoons. An hour or two before sunset
the terrace of the Piazza Trinit√† di Monti
begins to be thronged with pedestrians, who
lean over the marble balustrade, gazing at the
incomparable pictured panorama where the
vast dome of St. Peter&rsquo;s, the dense pines of the
Villa Pamphilia-Doria on the Janiculum, and
the dark cypress groves on Monte Mario loom
up against the golden western sky.</p>

<p>Compared with the extensive parks of modern
cities the Monte Pincio would prefigure
itself as a drive for fairies alone. It comprises
a few acres only, thickly decorated with trees
and shrubbery, with a casino for the orchestra
that plays every afternoon, and a circular carriage
drive so limited in extent that the same
carriage comes in view every few minutes.</p>

<p>The Eternal City has had so many birthdays
that one would fancy them to have become
negligible; but it was announced on April 21
of 1907 that the date was a special anniversary,
and she took on aspects of festivity. The municipal
palaces and museums were hung with
tapestries, flags were flying from the Capitol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the municipal guards were all in full dress uniform
and the municipal orchestra played in the
Piazza Colonna. The historic bell began ringing
at eight in the morning in peals that were
well calculated to call the C√¶sars from their
tombs and which might, indeed, have been mistaken
for the final trumpet calls of Gabriel.
But the Romans take their pleasures rather
sadly and sternly,&mdash;not like the light-hearted
Florentines in song and laughter, or with the
joyous abandon of the Neapolitans,&mdash;so there
was no special manifestation on the part of the
populace, and the day, cold, gloomy, and cheerless,
did not inspire gayety.</p>

<p>When the Republic of Rome was established
(on Feb. 9, 1849) a provisional government was
appointed. In March of that year Mazzini
proposed that the assembly should appoint a
Committee of War, and it was decided to send
troops to Piedmont. Later a triumvirate, consisting
of Mazzini, Saffi, and Armellini, was
formed, but disaster was near. In April the
French troops landed at Civit√† Vecchia, and the
Italians prepared to defend their country from
the control of Louis Napoleon. Mazzini is
said to have been &ldquo;the life and the soul&rdquo; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
this defence. But the Republic was doomed,
and when it had fallen the Pope returned, only
under the protection of the French. But the
French Empire, too, was doomed to fall; and
when Garibaldi transferred his successes to
Victor Emmanuel, the monarchy was consolidated
by the union of Rome with Italy, and the
present &ldquo;Via Venti Settembre&rdquo; in Rome&mdash;the
street named to commemorate that 20th of
September, 1870, on which the Italian troops
entered the city and the Papal reign ended&mdash;perpetuates
the story of those eventful days.
&ldquo;Victor Emmanuel, Cavour, and Garibaldi have
been designated, along with Mazzini, as the
founders of the modern Italy,&rdquo; said Dr. William
Clarke, &ldquo;but a broad line divides Mazzini from
the others.&rdquo; Dr. Clarke sees between Cavour
and Mazzini &ldquo;the everlasting conflict between
the idealist and the man of the world. The
former,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;stands by the intellect
and the conscience; the latter by the limitations
of actual fact and the practical difficulties of
the case,&rdquo; and Dr. Clarke notes further:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It was pre-eminently Mazzini who gave to
Italy the breath of a new life, who taught her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
people constancy in devotion to an ideal good.
Prophets are rarely successful in their own day,
and so it has been with the prophet of modern
Italy. The making of Italy has not proceeded
in the way he hoped it would; for the Italians,
who are an eminently subtle and diplomatic
people, have apparently thought it best to bend
to the hard facts by which they have been surrounded.
But if, as Emerson teaches, facts are
fluid to thought, we may believe that the ideas
of Mazzini will yet prevail in the nation of his
birth, and that he may yet be regarded as the
spiritual father of the future Italian commonwealth.
For of him, if of any modern man, we
may say that he</p>

<p>Between the period of the establishment of
the Roman Republic in 1849 and the consummation
of United Italy in 1870 the years were
rich to the artist, whatever they may have been
to philosopher and patriot. The way for the
painter and the sculptor seems to have been a
flowery and a pictorial one,&mdash;a very <i>via buona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
fortuna</i>, through a golden, artistic atmosphere.
The perpetual excursions may lead the serious
spectator to wonder where working hours come
in, but, at all events, those days are rich in
color. Friends grouped together by the unerring
law of elective affinities loitered in galleries
and churches. San Martina, near the
Mamertine prisons, was a point of interest
because of Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s bequest to it of the
original cast of his beautiful statue of &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;
which is in Copenhagen. This is, perhaps,
the finest work ever conceived by the Danish
sculptor, and is one that no visitor of to-day
can behold unmoved. Both Canova and Bernini
are also represented in this church,&mdash;the
former by a statue of &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; and the latter
by a bust of Pietro da Cortona. Beneath the
present Church of San Martina is the ancient
one containing the shrine of the martyr, under
a superb bronze altar. Of this church, Mrs.
Jameson says in her &ldquo;Sacred and Legendary
Art&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;At the foot of the Capitoline Hill, on the
left hand as we descend from the Ara C&oelig;li
into the Forum, there stood in very ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
times a small chapel, dedicated to St. Martina,
a Roman virgin. The veneration paid to her
was of very early date, and the Roman people
were accustomed to assemble there on the first
day of the year. This observance was, however,
confined to the people, and was not very
general till 1634, an era which connects her in
rather an interesting manner with the history of
art. In this year, as they were about to repair
her chapel, they discovered, walled into the
foundations, a sarcophagus of terra cotta, in
which was the body of a young female, whose
severed head reposed in a separate casket.
These remains were very naturally supposed to
be those of the saint who had been so long
venerated on that spot. The discovery was
hailed with the utmost exultation, not by the
people only, but by those who led the minds
and consciences of the people. The Pope himself,
Urban VIII, composed hymns in her
praise; and Cardinal Francesco Barberini undertook
to rebuild her church.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The painter, Pietro da Cortona, entered into
this feeling and at his own expense built the
chapel and painted for its altar piece the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
representing the saint in triumph, while
the temple in which she has gone to sacrifice
falls in ruins from a raging tempest.</p>

<p>In any stray ramble in Rome the sojourner
might chance, at any moment, upon obelisk, a
pedestal or inscription linked with the great
names of the historic past. Hawthorne has recorded
how, by mere chance, he turned from
the Via delle Quattro Fontane into the Via Quirinale
and was thus lured on to an obelisk and
a fountain on the pedestal of which on one side
was the inscription, &ldquo;Opus Phidias,&rdquo; and on
the other, &ldquo;Opus Praxiteles,&rdquo; and he exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;What a city is this, when one may stumble, by
mere chance&mdash;at a street corner as it were&mdash;on
the works of two such sculptors! I do not know
the authority,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;on which these
statues (Castor and Pollux I presume) are attributed
to Phidias and Praxiteles; but they impressed
me as noble and godlike, and I feel inclined
to take them for what they purport to be.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>While the Papal ceremonies are neither so
frequent nor so magnificent as in former days,
still any hotel guest in Rome is liable, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
morning, on coming down to the <i>salle-√†-manger</i>
for coffee, to find every woman (who is taking
her Rome seriously) arrayed in a black robe
with a black lace veil on her head. One would
fancy they were all a procession of nuns, about
to retire from the world into the strict seclusion
of the cloister. But it is nothing so momentous.
It is only that every lady, with the
devotion to spectacles which every visitor in
Rome feels, as a matter of course, has secured
the pink ticket entitling her to admission to
the Vatican Palace to see the &ldquo;passage&rdquo; of the
Pope, as he makes his way, attended by the
Cardinals of the Sacred College, to the Sistine
Chapel where his Holiness &ldquo;creates&rdquo; new
Cardinals. Although rumored that the spectacle
will be a gorgeous one, that the Pope
will be carried aloft preceded by the silver
trumpeters and attended by the Cardinals and
the ambassadors and other dignitaries in the
full dress of their ceremonial costumes and their
orders, the reality is less impressive. Some
feminine enthusiasts fare forth at the heroic
hour of eight, although the procession is not
announced to pass until a quarter after ten
(which in Italy should be translated as a quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
after eleven, at the earliest, if not after twelve,
which would be the more probable), in order
to secure good standing room. For everybody
is to stand&mdash;of course, comfort being a thing
conspicuous only by its absence in Italy! Those
of us too well aware by the experiences of previous
visits to Italy that no Italian function
was ever on time, from the starting of a
railway train to the crowning of a king, only
betake ourselves to the glories of the Palazzo
Vaticano at the hour named, and we have
then&mdash;as one&rsquo;s prophetic soul or his commonplace
memory warned him&mdash;to wait more
than an hour wedged into a dense crowd of
all nationalities, none of whom seem at this
particular juncture, at least, to be at all overburdened
with good manners. And what went
they out for to seek? Instead of an impressive
spectacle&mdash;a thing to remember for a lifetime&mdash;one
merely sees Pius X walking, surrounded
by his Cardinals in a group,&mdash;not a procession,&mdash;he
alone in the centre with his mitre on his
head,&mdash;the whole scene hardly lasting over a
minute, and as his Holiness is not as tall as
most of his Cardinals, he is almost hidden from
view. It had been rumored that the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was to be borne aloft in the Papal chair, preceded
by the traditional white fan and the
silver trumpets; but the present Pope is temperamentally
inclined to minimize all the ceremonials
investing his sacred office.</p>

<p>Yet there is always a thrill in entering the
Vatican. To ascend that splendid <i>Scala Regia</i>
designed by Bernini, with one of the most ingeniously
treated perspective effects to be found,
it may be, in the entire world; to cross
this <i>Scala</i> with its interesting frescoes by
Salviati and others; to see at near range the
picturesque Swiss Guard,&mdash;surely any pretext
to enjoy such a morning is easily accepted of
whatever occurrence one may grasp in order
to obtain the hour.</p>

<p>One curious feature of the past is to-day
equally in evidence in Rome. Strolling at
any time into the Church of San Agostino one
beholds a curious spectacle. It is in this church
that is placed the beautiful bronze statue of
the Virgin and Child by Sansovino. It is approached
by a platform on which is placed a
stool that enables one to mount and thus reach
the foot of the statue, which is kissed and the
wish of the devotee is offered. This Madonna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
is believed to have the power to grant each wish
and prayer; to heal the sick; restore the blind,
the deaf, and the lame; to grant immunity
from loss or illness; to grant success and prosperity.
The poor Madonna must have her
hands full with these avalanches of petitions,
but she sits calmly in state and, if the striking
testimony of votive offerings can be credited,
she is most amiable in granting the prayers of
her devotees. For she is hung with priceless
jewels; necklaces, brooches, bracelets, diamond
and ruby and sapphire rings on her
fingers, she is a blaze of splendor. Around
this statue there is a perpetual crowd, whatever
hour of day one chances to wander in, and
from prince to beggar the bronze foot is kissed,
as each waits his turn to mount the stool and
prefer his secret wish. The walls of the church
are covered with the votive offerings to the
Madonna for her aid,&mdash;rich jewels, orders,
tablets,&mdash;offerings of all kinds. In this church
is entombed the body of Santa Monica, the
mother of St. Augustine, placed in an urn of
verd-antique, in a special chapel beautifully
decorated. After preferring one&rsquo;s secret wish
to the Virgin one must wander on to the Fontane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
de Trevi and throw his penny into the
water to insure his return to Rome, and then
he may rest, <i>mens conscia <a name="tn200" id="tn200"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'recta'">recti</ins></i>!</p>

<p>Although Holy Week in Rome has less ceremonial
observance in these latter days than those
of the impressive scenes so vividly portrayed
by Mme. de Sta√´l in &ldquo;Corinne,&rdquo; it still attracts
a multitude of visitors and offers much to touch
and thrill the life of the spirit, quite irrespective
as to whether the visitor be of the Catholic
or Protestant faith. In the great essentials of
Christianity, all followers of Christ unite. The
Pope does not now take part in public services
on Easter, and that scene of the Pontifical
blessing from the balcony of St. Peter&rsquo;s given
to the multitude below who throng the piazza
remains only in memory and in record. But
the stately and solemn services of Good Friday
in the vast and grand interior of St. Peter&rsquo;s are
an experience to linger forever in memory.
The three hours&rsquo; service&mdash;the chanting of the
Miserere&mdash;was a scene to impress the imagination.
This service is held in the late afternoon
of Good Friday, in the tribune of St. Peter&rsquo;s,
the extreme end of the church where the vast
window of yellow glass gives a perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
golden light. The chair believed to have been
that of St. Peter&rsquo;s is here placed, enclosed in
ivory and supported by statues of four Fathers
of the church, St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, St.
Chrysostom, and St. Athanasius, from a design
of Bernini.</p>

<p>In the tribune is the tomb of Urban VIII
(who was Matteo Barberini), of which the
redundant decoration tells the story that it is
also Bernini&rsquo;s work. Opposite this tomb is
that of Paul III, by della Porta, under the
supervision of Michael Angelo, it is said, and
the beauty and dignity of the bronze figure of
the aged Pope, in the act of giving the benediction,
quite confirm this tradition. On a
tablet in the wall of the tribune are engraved
the names of all the bishops and prelates who,
in 1854, accepted the belief of the Immaculate
Conception,&mdash;this tablet being placed by the
order of Pio Nono.</p>

<p>In this tribune on the late afternoon of the
Good Friday of 1907 the seats were filled with
worshippers to listen to the three hours&rsquo; chant
of the Miserere. Princes and peasants sat side
by side, and an immense throng who could not
find seats stood, often wandering away in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
dim distances of the cathedral and ever and
again returning. The high altar, where Canova&rsquo;s
beautiful figure of the kneeling Pope
always enchains the visitor, was, as usual, surrounded.
The lights burned&mdash;these perpetual
lamps&mdash;and the moving throng went and
came. The scene grew mystic, dream-like,
as the solemn music floated on the air.</p>

<p>The Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, on the
left of the cathedral, was made into the sepulchre
that day, and anything more beautiful
than the myriad altar lights and the flowers could
not be imagined. At the altar black-robed nuns
were kneeling, and all over the chapel, kneeling
on the floor, were people of all grades and ranks
of life, from the duchess and princess to the
beggar woman with a ragged shawl on her
shoulders and her baby in her arms. St. Peter&rsquo;s
was nearly filled all that day with people, not
crowded, but apparently thronged in almost
every part.</p>

<p>The altar in the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament
was one mass of deep red roses. The
chapel was completely darkened, but the blaze
of myriads of tall candles illuminated the roses
and the black-robed nuns and the black-robed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
devotees. It was a scene never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Even in the latter-day Rome, historic names
are not wanting. One of these, the Princess
Christina Bonaparte, <i>n√©e</i> Ruspoli, died in 1907
in her Roman villa in Via Venti Settembre. She
was the widow of Prince Napoleon Charles
Bonaparte and a cousin of the Empress Eug√©nie.
With her husband in Paris until 1870, she fled
(whilst her husband was fighting at Metz) as
soon as the Commune was proclaimed. The
princess was considered a beautiful woman and
her portrait had been painted by Ernest H√©bert,
but it was lost when the Palace of the Tuileries
was destroyed in 1870.</p>

<p>With this princess dies the name of the Bonaparte
family. Her daughters, Donna Maria
Gotti-Bonaparte and Princess Maria della
Moskowa, were often with her in Rome.</p>

<p>The Palazzo Bonaparte is very near Porta
Pia. Although called a palace, it is simply a
plain house of some five stories, with narrow
halls and stone staircases, no elevator, no electric
lights. The princess occupied the first
floor, while the apartments above were let to
various families.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of the royal palaces there
are few in which suites are not obtainable for
residence by any one who desires them.</p>

</div>

<p>It was at a pleasant <i>d√©je√ªner</i> one spring day
in Rome that the project was launched, that
we should go motoring that afternoon to Frascati,
Albano, Castel Gandolfo, Lago di Nemi,
and all that wonderful region. We were lunching
with a friend who had a charming apartment
in one of the sumptuous old palaces of Rome,
where, in a niche on the marble staircase, the
statue of C√¶sar Augustus stood,&mdash;a copy of
the famous statue in the Capitoline,&mdash;where
lofty, decorated ceilings, old paintings and
sculptures adorned the rooms, and where from
the windows we looked out on the tragedy-haunted
Castel San Angelo, with the dome of
San Pietro in the background. Our friend
who invited us to fly in his motor had brought
his touring car over from America. The one
note of new luxury now is for travellers to
journey with their touring cars. In a year or
two more it will be airships or soaring machines.
On this wonderful May afternoon,
all azure and gold, we started off in the great,
luxurious touring car which was arranged even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to carry two trunks, with a safe in it for the
deposit of valuables, a hamper for refreshments,
and, indeed, almost every conceivable convenience.
On we flew through Rome, past
the great Basilica of San Maria Maggiore;
past the wonderful pile of San Giovanni Laterano,
with the colossal statues of the apostles
surmounting the fa√ßade; through the Porta
San Giovanni into the narrow, walled lane
leading out on the Campagna; on, on, to the
Alban hills. We flew past olive orchards and
vineyards, and the vast green pasture lands of
the Campagna whose vivid green was ablaze with
scarlet poppies. Far away to the west there
was a white shining line&mdash;the line of the sea.</p>

<p>At Frascati we stopped at the Villa Torlonia,
the country place of the ducal family,
whose grand Roman palazzo is in the Bocca di
Leone in the old part of Rome. The Torlonia
have an only daughter, Donna Teresa, whose
<i>d√©butante</i> ball a year ago is said to have been
the most magnificent entertainment in Rome
for fifty years. A writer, in a recent article
on the nobility of Rome, said of this family:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The Torlonia figure repeatedly in the novels
of Thackeray, who was never tired of portraying
them. They have been most useful citizens,
and since the days of the old army contractor,
who founded the house, have augmented the
family wealth by judicious investments, especially
in connection with the draining and reclaiming
of the marsh lands that abound in
the former Papal States. They have contracted
matrimonial alliances with the Colonna, with
the Borghese, the Belmonte, the Doria, and
the Sforza.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The Villa Torlonia at Frascati is a very
large estate with extensive gardens, terraces,
and a cascade of three falls on the hillside,
which is turned on (the water) at pleasure.
The house, however, is a shabby-looking affair,
a two or three story, rambling, yellow structure,
which, at Newport, would not be considered
too good for the gardener.</p>

<p>After the usual fashion of the Italians who
seldom travel, the Torlonia, wealthy as they
are, simply remove from their palace in Rome
to their villa at Frascati instead of travelling
to Switzerland, Germany, or elsewhere in the
summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cumberland
were the guests of the Torlonia that day, the
entire party enjoying themselves <i>al fresco</i>, and
the beautiful cascade pouring down within the
near distance.</p>

<p>These outlying towns, Frascati, Albano, Castel
Gandolfo, and Lago di Nemi, the picturesque
group in the Alban Mountains, are some
sixteen to eighteen miles from Rome. These
Alban hills rise like an island from the vast
plain of the Campagna, the highest point being
some three thousand feet above sea level. They
are covered with villages and castles and villas,
and have in all a population of some fifty thousand.
The region is volcanic, and the beautiful
Lago di Nemi and Lago di Albano were the
craters of extinct volcanoes. All this region
was the haunt of Cicero, Virgil, and Livy. At
Tusculum, near Frascati, are the remains of
Cicero&rsquo;s villa, and also of an ancient theatre
hewn out of solid rock. The view to the west
toward Rome is most beautiful. The dome of
St. Peter&rsquo;s crowns the Eternal City; and the
Campagna&mdash;a sea of green&mdash;is as infinite
in sight as is the Mediterranean. There are
splendid villas and estates in these Alban hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that belong to the Roman nobility, and here
the Pope has his summer palace. &ldquo;The Alban
Mount is also full of historical and legendary
interest,&rdquo; says a writer on the country around
Rome. &ldquo;The Latin tribe, one of the constituent
elements of the Roman people, had here
its seat. Upon the highest peak of the range
was the temple of Jupiter Latiaris, where all
the tribes of Latin blood, the Romans included,
met every year to worship; and where the victorious
generals of the Republic repaired to
offer praises and acknowledgments. In these
mountain glens undoubtedly most of that
ballad literature of Rome, the loss of which
Macaulay so eloquently laments and so successfully
restores, had its origin. Nor need the
scholar be reminded that this is the scene of
the most original and vigorous portions of the
√Üneid of Virgil; nor how the genius of the
poet, which rather languidly recounts the traditions
borrowed from Greece, wakes to new life,
when he feels his feet upon his own soil and
deals with Latin names and Latin legends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati is celebrated
for its fantastic waterworks in elaborate
fountains and cascades. In the gardens a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
statue of Pan with a pipe of reeds and one of a
satyr with a trumpet are made to play (both
the pipe and the trumpet) by water. The
hydraulic engineer must have found in Frascati
his earthly paradise, for he commanded the
water to leap into foam and spray in the air,
to rush down marble terraces, and to form
itself into obelisks of liquid silver.</p>

<p>At Grotto Ferrata is a vast monastery of
monks of the Order of Basilio (Greek), a
monastery so colossal as to be mistaken for a
fortress. The chapel has frescoes by Domenichino.
At Castel Gandolfo is the summer
Papal palace, that has not been occupied by a
Pope since the overthrowing of the temporal
power in 1870. It has a beautiful and commanding
view toward Rome. It was built by
Urban VIII.</p>

<p>All the magic of Italy is in this picturesque
excursion. In the vast grounds of the Villa
Barberini are the ruins of the ancient palace
and gardens of Domitian. On one hillside is
a broken wall; a long avenue of ilex trees
reveals here and there fragments of mosaic
pavement. Crumbling niches hold fragments
of statues. The hill itself is still pierced with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the long tunnels driven through it by Domitian
that he might pass unseen,&mdash;presumably safe
from his enemies,&mdash;from the palace to the
gardens. From the parapet, Rome is seen
across the shining Campagna and the dome of
Michael Angelo gleams against the blue Italian
sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wreck is beautiful,&rdquo; writes Mrs. Humphry
Ward, in &ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo; of this romantic
spot; &ldquo;for it is masked in the gloom of the
overhanging trees; or hidden behind dropping
veils of ivy; or lit up by straggling patches of
broom and cytisus that thrust themselves through
the gaps in the Roman brickwork and shine
golden in the dark. At the foot of the wall,
along its whole length, runs a low marble conduit
that held the sweetest, liveliest water.
Lilies of the valley grow beside it, breathing
scent into the shadowed air; while on the outer
or garden side of the path the grass is purple
with long-stalked violets, or pink with the
sharp heads of the cyclamen. And a little
farther, from the same grass, there shoots up,
in happy neglect, tall camellia trees, ragged
and laden, strewing the ground red and white
beneath them. And above the camellias again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the famous stone-pines of the villa climb into
the high air, overlooking the plain and the sea,
peering at Rome and Soracte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One could wander all day in the strange
ruins of the old Barberini grounds, and in
the vast spaces of the gardens and through
the Villa Doria.</p>

<p>The beauty of the avenue of ilex trees through
which we flew from Castel Gandolfo to Lago
di Nemi surpasses description. This lake, some
four miles in circumference, lies in a crater
hollow, with precipitous hills surrounding it,
the water so clear that the ancients called it
the &ldquo;Mirror of Diana.&rdquo; In it was constructed
an artificial island in the design of
a Roman state barge.</p>

<p>Over the long viaduct at Ariccia we flew;
everywhere in the little town people, donkeys&mdash;an
almost indistinguishable mass&mdash;filled the
narrow streets; and thus on to Genzano and
the Lago di Nemi, with its fabled fleet at the
bottom.</p>

<p>The Chigi woods, that fill the deep ravine
under the great viaduct at Ariccia, were in the
most brilliant emerald green. Past these forests
lay the vast stretch of the Pontine Marshes; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
turning toward Rome again, the splendor of
the sunset flamed in the sky. One could but
recall Mrs. Humphry Ward&rsquo;s vivid picture of
a storm seen over this part of the Campagna:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The sunset was rushing to its height through
every possible phase of violence and splendor.
From the Mediterranean, storm clouds were
rising fast to the assault and conquest of the
upper sky, which still above the hills shone
blue and tranquil. But the northwest wind and
the sea were leagued against it. They sent out
threatening fingers and long spinning veils of
cloud across it&mdash;skirmishers that foretold the
black and serried lines, the torn and monstrous
masses behind. Below these wild tempest
shapes again&mdash;in long spaces resting on the
sea&mdash;the heaven was at peace, shining in delicate
greens and yellows, infinitely translucent
and serene, above the dazzling lines of water.
Over Rome itself there was a strange massing
and curving of the clouds. Between their blackness
and the deep purple of the Campagna rose
the city&mdash;pale phantom&mdash;upholding one great
dome, and one only, to view of night and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
world. Round and above and behind, beneath
the long flat arch of the storm, glowed a furnace
of scarlet light. The buildings of the city were
faint specks within its fierce intensity, dimly
visible through a sea of fire. St. Peter&rsquo;s alone,
without visible foundation or support, had consistence,
form, identity; and between the city
and the hills, waves of blue and purple shade,
forerunners of the night, stole over the Campagna
towards the higher ground. But the
hills themselves were still shining, still clad in
rose and amethyst, caught in gentler repetition
from the wildness of the west. Pale rose even
the olive gardens; rose the rich brown fallows,
the emerging farms; while drawn across the
Campagna from north to south, as though some
mighty brush had just laid it there for sheer
lust of color, sheer joy in the mating it with the
rose,&mdash;one long strip of sharpest, purest green.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The Villa <a name="tn213" id="tn213"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Falconicri'">Falconieri</ins>, in Frascati, which was
built by Cardinal Ruffini, with the old ilex tree
preserved in the portals, has recently been purchased
by the Emperor of Germany, who proposes
to transform it into an Academy for the
accommodation of German students in Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
These national academies draw their corresponding
numbers of students from the nations
thus represented, and contribute to the cosmopolitan
aspects of Rome. The American
Academy in Rome is now being transferred
from the Ludovisi quarter to a large and convenient
building outside Porta Pia.</p>

<p>Perhaps the eminently social quality of
Roman life may be indirectly due to the lack of
library privileges which is a conspicuous defect
in Rome. The Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele,
under the courteous administration of Commendatore
Conte Guili, has, it is true, a collection
of over half a million volumes and thousands
of very rare and valuable manuscripts.
It has a large public reading room, and books
are loaned on the signature of any embassy or
consulate; yet this library, while offering peculiar
advantages to theological and other special
students and readers, does not afford any extended
privileges to the general reader of modern
English and American publications. It is located
in a grim and forbidding old stone palace,
approached by an obscure lane from the Corso,
where, as there is no sidewalk, the pedestrian
shares the narrow, dark, cold, stone-paved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
little street with carts, donkeys, peasants, and
beggars.</p>

<p>The great monument to King Victor Emmanuel,
of mingled architecture and sculpture, a colossal
structure of white marble with arches and
pillars forming beautiful colonnades, the capital
of each column heavily carved, and the sculpture,
which is being done by a number of artists,
will be of the most artistic and beautiful order.
This memorial will occupy an entire block, and
it is located very near the Capitol. All the old
buildings in the vicinity will be torn down to
give a fine vista for this transcendently noble
and sumptuous memorial.</p>

<p>The directors of this work aim to have it
completed and ready to be unveiled in 1911, the
jubilee year of Italy&rsquo;s resurrection as a united
country.</p>

<p>Encircled by the old Aurelian wall and near
the great pyramid that marks the tomb of
Caius Cestius, who died 12 B.C., lies the Protestant
cemetery of Rome, full of bloom and
fragrance and beauty, under the dark, solemn
cypress trees that stand like ever-watchful
sentinels. When Keats was buried here (in
1820), Shelley wrote of &ldquo;the romantic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
lovely cemetery .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under the pyramid of
Caius Cestius, and the mossy walls and towers
now mouldering and desolate which formed
the circuit of ancient Rome. The cemetery
is an open space among the ruins, covered
even in winter with violets and daisies. It
might make one in love with death,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;to think of being buried in so sweet a
place.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption noi"><small>PORTA SAN PAOLA, PYRAMID OF CAIUS CESTIUS, ROME</small></p>
</div>

<p>In the old cemetery (immediately adjoining
the pyramid and separated from the new one
by a wall) is the grave of Keats (who died in
1821) with its unique inscription, &ldquo;Here lies
one whose name was writ in water.&rdquo; Beside it is
that of his friend, Joseph Severn, who died in
1829, and near these the grave of John Bell,
the famous writer on surgery and anatomy. In
the new or more modern cemetery the visitor
lingers by the graves of Shelley and his friend,
Trelawney; August Goethe (the son of the
poet); of William and Mary Howitt, who
died in 1879 and 1888. Not merely, however,
do the names of Keats and Shelley allure the
visitor to poetic meditations; but here lie the
earthly forms of many a poet, painter, and
sculptor of our own country, with their wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and children, who have sought in the Eternal
City the atmosphere for art and who, enamoured
by the loveliness of Rome, continued there for
all their remaining years. These graves, these
sculptured memorials, are eloquent with the
joys, the sorrows, the achievements and the
failures, the success and the defeat, of the
artistic life in a foreign land. Many of these
memorial sculptures are the work of the husband
or the father, into which is inseparably
joined the personal tenderness to the artist&rsquo;s
skill. Especially noticeable are the graves of
the wives of three American sculptors,&mdash;William
Wetmore Story, Richard S. Greenough, and
Franklin Simmons. Each of these is marked
by a memorial sculpture created by the husband,
and the three different conceptions of
these sculptors are interesting to contrast. That
of Mr. Story is of an angel with outspread
wings, kneeling, her head bowed in the utter
despair and desolation of hopeless sorrow.
The figure has the greatest delicacy of beauty
and refinement and tenderness; but it is the
grief that has no support of faith, the grief that
has no vision of divine consolation. On the
memorial monument is simply the name, Emelyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Story, born in Boston, 1820, died in Rome
in 1898, and the note that it is the last work of
W. W. Story, in memory of his beloved wife.
Here, also, is Mr. Story buried, his name and
dates of birth and death (1819-1901) alone
being inscribed.</p>

<p>At the tomb of Sarah B. Greenough, the wife
of Richard S. Greenough, the monument is
designed to represent Psyche escaping from the
bondage of mortality. This Psyche is emerging
from her garments and she holds in her
hand a lamp. On this is the inscription: &ldquo;Her
loss was that as of a keystone to an arch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Greenough was a very accomplished
musician, and she had the unique honor of
having been made a member of the &ldquo;Arcadians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The memorial sculpture over the grave of
Mrs. Franklin Simmons is, as elsewhere noted,
the work of her husband, a figure called &ldquo;The
Angel of the Resurrection.&rdquo; The angel is represented
as a male figure (Gabriel) holding in
the left hand a golden trumpet while the right
is outstretched. His wings are spread, his face
partly turned to the right. The form is partially
draped and in every detail is instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with a complete harmony; every fold of the
drapery, every curve of the body, and the lofty
and triumphant expression of the face in its
ineffable glory of achievement proclaim the
triumph of immortality. It stands on a pedestal
that gives it, from the base of the pedestal
to the tip of the outstretched wings, a height of
some twenty-one feet. This monument, seen
against a background of dark cypress trees,
speaks the word of positive and complete faith
in the divine promise of eternal life.</p>

<span class="i1">Things perfected, more or less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the heaven&rsquo;s height&mdash;far and steep.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The visitor lingers over the grave of that
interesting painter, J. Rollin Tilton, whose landscapes
from Egypt and Italian scenes were so
vivid and picturesque.</p>

<p>Richard Henry Dana, the elder, born in Boston
in 1815, came to Rome to die in 1882.</p>

<p>Very near the tomb of William Wetmore and
Emelyn Story is that of Constance Fenimore
Woolson. Over the graves of William and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Mary Howitt is the inscription: &ldquo;Let not your
heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also
in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the wall just back of the new tomb erected
over the ashes of Shelley by Onslow Ford
in 1891 is a memorial tablet placed to Frederick
W. H. Myers, bearing this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;This tablet is placed to the memory of
Frederick William Henry Myers, born at Keswick,
Cumberland, Feb. 6, 1843; died in Rome,
Jan. 17, 1901. &lsquo;He asked life of Thee, and
Thou gavest him long life ever and forever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Over the grave of John Addington Symonds,
whose best monument is in his admirable History
of the Renaissance in Italy, is a Latin
inscription written by Professor Jowett of Oxford,
and a stanza from the Greek of Cleanthes,
translated by Mr. Symonds as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lead thou, our God, law, reason, motion, life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All names for Thee alike are vain and hollow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead me, for I will follow without strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if I strive, still more I blindly follow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>John Addington Symonds, who certainly
ranks as the most gifted interpreter of Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in her art, her legends and associations, and
her landscape loveliness, died in the Rome he
so loved in 1893. His wife was ill in Venice,
but his daughter, Margaret,&mdash;his inseparable
companion and his helper in his work,&mdash;was
with him. It is Miss Symonds who prefaced
a memorial volume to her father with
the exquisite lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O Love; we two shall go no longer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lands of summer beyond the sea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Near the graves of Keats and of his friend,
Joseph Severn, are those of Augustus William
Hare and John Gibson, the sculptor, who died
in 1868. Some ten years before Hawthorne,
meeting Gibson at a dinner given by T. Buchanan
Read, wrote of him that it was whispered
about the table that he had been in Rome
for forty-two years and that he had a quiet,
self-contained aspect as of one who had spent
a calm life among his clay and marble.</p>

<p>Dwight Benton, an American painter and
writer, who was for some time in the diplomatic
service and whose home had been in
Rome for more than a quarter of a century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
lies buried here. For many years he was the
editor of <i>The Roman World</i>, which still sustains
the interesting character that marked it
during his editorship. Of his work in art a
friend wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In painting, as in literature, Dwight Benton
took his inspiration from nature. His paintings
of Italian scenery are true and faithful representations
of its character and atmospheric
effects. His tramps on the Roman Campagna
were long and often tiring, but he worked with
all an artist&rsquo;s enthusiasm, unmindful of cold,
rain, and even hunger. He would delight, as
all true artists, in an old convent, a tree, a tower,
a cross, which he would reproduce with a
peculiar and striking perfection of tone and
color. In his paintings of Keats&rsquo;s and Shelley&rsquo;s
tombs, not only are the slabs and marble there,
but there, also, in all their naturalness, are the
stately pines and cypresses above, with the sunshine
and shadows alternating between them,
and in the background the turreted top of
St. Paul&rsquo;s Gateway, the Pyramid of Caius
Cestius, all lending effect and picturesqueness
to the whole.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The present King of Italy purchased one of
Mr. Benton&rsquo;s paintings, called &ldquo;Giornata di
tristezza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While art abounds in Rome, less can be said
for literature. There is a large and admirable
selected Italian library in connection with the
Collegio Romano; but while these books circulate,
under certain conditions, to visitors, and
the courtesy of the librarian and his staff is
generously kind, the location and the Italian
methods render it a matter of some difficulty
to avail one&rsquo;s self of its resources. In the
Piazza di Spagna there are two circulating
libraries, but although one of these claims
twenty-five thousand volumes, the majority are
of mediocre fiction and almost none, if any, of
the important modern works are to be found here.
The visitor who is a subscriber to this library
passes into a small, dark room, where one
window looking on the street hardly does more
than make the darkness visible, and he must
take the catalogue to the window and stand in
order to decipher the list, which is hardly,
indeed, worth the trouble, as there are very
few volumes of any pretension to importance in
the collection, and of late years no additions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
apparently, have ever been made. The other
circulating library, while far preferable, is still
in crowded rooms and the assortment is limited.
The visitor in Rome who cares for reading
matter looks forward with delight to Florence,
with its noble circulating library, to which
access is so easy and whose conduct in all ways
is so convenient and grateful to the guest.</p>

<p>In Rome, however, one finds his romance
embodied in life and his history written in the
streets and in the marvellous structures. His
poetry is in her art, her ruins, her magical
loveliness of hillside vistas, her infinite views
over the Campagna, her sapphire skies, and her
luminous, golden atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<span class="nob">DAY-DREAMS IN NAPLES, AMALFI, AND CAPRI</span></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;With dreamful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spirit lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where summer sings but never dies.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Naples</span> is the paradise of excursions. It is set
in the heart of incomparable loveliness. Over
its sapphire sea one sails away&mdash;to the Fortunate
Isles, or some others equally alluring.
Its heights and adjacent mountains offer views
that one might well cross the ocean to enjoy.
Its atmosphere is full of classic interest; of song,
and story, and legend, and romance; of history,
too, which in its tragic and exciting episodes is
not less vivid in color and in strange studies
of human life than is any romance. Naples
is the city of fascination. Rome is stately and
impressive; Florence is all beauty and enchantment;
Genoa is picturesque; Venice is a
dream city; but Naples is simply&mdash;fascinating.
There is the common life of the streets and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
populace continually <i>en sc√®ne</i>; the people who
are at home on the sunny side in winter, or the
shady side in summer; there is the social life
of the nobility, which is brilliant and vivacious.
The excursions, of which Naples is the centre,
are the chief interest to travellers, and these,
while possible in winter, are far more enjoyable
in the early spring. Still even in midwinter
the days are sunny, and while the air is crisp
and cool, it is not cold. The grass is as green
as in June; but the foliage and flowers are more
or less withered. Naples has the high and the
lower town, the former the more desirable, and
the fine hotels perched on the terraces, with
the view all over the Bay of Naples, Capri,
Sorrento, and Vesuvius, offer a vista hardly to be
duplicated in the entire world. The lower town
has its fine hotels on the water&rsquo;s edge, with a
beautiful view over the bay, less enchanting
than when seen from above. The Bay of Naples
is enclosed in two semicircular arms that
extend far out at sea, the southern reaching
nearly to Capri, while near the termination of the
northern,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 8em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fair Ischia smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&rsquo;er liquid miles.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noi">Far out at sea the sun shines dazzlingly on
the blue Mediterranean. The landscape is full
of those curious formations that are always
inherent in volcanic regions. The region surrounding
Naples is abrupt, picturesque, with the
same irregular outline of hills that characterizes
the elevations in the Tonto basin in Arizona.
The vegetation is of the tropical type. The
cactus is common, although it grows to no such
monstrous heights as in Arizona. Orange and
lemon groves prevail as far as the eye can see.
On every height towns and villages crown the
crests and sweep in winding terraces around the
hillsides. Olive orchards abound. Castles and
ruins gleam white in the sunshine on the ledge
of rocky precipices. The curved shores shine
like broken lines of silver, with deep indentations
at Naples and at Castellammare. Between
these two points rises Vesuvius, the thin blue
smoke constantly curling from the summit that,
since the eruption of 1906, has lost much of its
elevation. In many places there is hardly the
width of a roadway between the low mountains
and the coast, but the cliffs are tropically luxurious
in vegetation. Everywhere the habitations
of the people crowd the space. From the monasteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and the castles that crown the heights,
both distant and near to the clustered villages
of the plain and those clinging to the
hillsides, the scene is one unending panorama
of human life. For Naples is only the focussing
point of these densely populated regions of
Southern Italy. The city stretches along the
coast on both sides her semicircular bay; but
the terraced hills, the stretches of land beyond,
and every peak and valley are thickly sown
with human habitations. Its commanding
heights, two of which rise in the middle of the
town, and its beautiful mirrored expanse of
water give to it the most unparalleled variety
and beauty of landscape loveliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What words can analyze,&rdquo; says George S.
Hillard, &ldquo;the parts and details of this matchless
panorama, or unravel that magic web of
beauty into which palaces, villas, forests, gardens,
vineyards, the mountains, and the sea are
woven? What pen can paint the soft curves,
the gentle undulations, the flowing outlines, the
craggy steeps, and the far-seen heights, which,
in their combination, are so full of grace and,
at the same time, expression? Words here are
imperfect instruments, and must yield their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
place to the pencil and the graver. But no
canvas can reproduce the light and color which
play round this enchanting region. No skill
can catch the changing hues of the distant
mountains, the star-points of the playing waves,
the films of purple and green which spread
themselves over the calm waters, the sunsets of
gold and orange, and the aerial veils of rose and
amethyst which drop upon the hills from the
skies of morning and evening. The author of
the book of Ecclesiasticus seems to have described
Naples, when he speaks of &lsquo;the pride
of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty
of heaven, with his glorious show.&rsquo; &lsquo;See Naples
and then die,&rsquo; is a well-known Italian saying;
but it should read, &lsquo;See Naples and then live.&rsquo;
One glance at such a scene stamps upon the
memory an image which, forever after, gives a
new value to life.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Naples gives to the visitor the impression of
being a city without a past. If she has a history,
it is not written in her streets. She is
poetic and picturesque, not historic. The
heights of Capodimonte and Sant&rsquo;Elmo divide
her into unequal parts, and there is the old
Naples which only the antiquarian or the political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
economist would wish to see, and the new
and modern city which is such a miracle of
beauty that one longs to stay forever, and fails
to wonder that the siren sought these shores.
Naples has either been very much misrepresented
as to its prevailing manners and customs,
or else it has changed within the past decade,
for, as a rule, the gentle courtesy and kindness
of the people are especially appealing. Augustus
often sojourned in Naples, and it was an
especially poetic haunt of Virgil, whose tomb is
here. Although the poverty and the primitive
life of the great masses of the people have been
widely discussed, it is yet true that Naples has
a very charming social life, and that the University
is a centre of learning and culture.
One of the oldest universities in Europe, it has
a faculty of over one hundred and twenty professors
and more than five thousand students.
A large and valuable library, and a mineralogical
collection which specialists from all over
the world come to study, are among the treasures
of this University, which was founded in
the early part of the thirteenth century by
Emperor Frederick William II. There is now in
process of erection a new group of buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which will embody the latest laboratory and
library and other privileges. Arch√¶ology is,
naturally, a special feature of the University of
Naples, and the proximity to Pompeii, Herculaneum,
and to the wonderful Pompeian collection
in the Museum of Naples affords peculiar
and unrivalled advantages to students. A bust
of Thomas Aquinas, during his life a lecturer
at this University, is one of the interesting treasures.
The Archives of the Kingdom of Naples
attract many a scholar and savant to this city.
There are in this collection (which is kept in
the monastery adjoining the Church of San
Severino) over forty thousand Greek manuscripts,
some of which date back to the year
700. The Naples Museum is the great repository
of all Pompeian art, and it is rich in sculpture;
but it is badly arranged and the vast series
of galleries and the long flights of stairs make
any study of its work so fatiguing that a visit
to it might rank as one of the seven labors of
Hercules.</p>

<p>In the royal museum of the Palazzo di
Capodimonte, which is located on the beautiful
height bearing that name, there are some pictures
that are well worth visiting, not because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
they are particularly good art, but because of
the interest attaching to the subjects. This
gallery is largely the work of modern Neapolitan
artists. Here is the celebrated picture of
Michael Angelo bending over the dead body of
Vittoria Colonna, kissing only her hand, and
haunted by the after-regret that he did not kiss
her forehead. Virginia Lebrun has here portraits
of Maria Theresa and of the Duchess of
Parma; there is one canvas (by Celentano) showing
Benvenuto Cellini at the Castel <a name="tn234" id="tn234"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Sant Angelo'">Sant&rsquo;Angelo</ins>;
a scene depicting the death of C√¶sar and a few
others of some degree of interest.</p>

<p>Curiously, Naples has never produced great
art. Salvator Rosa was, to be sure, a Neapolitan,
but his is almost the only name that has
made itself immortal in the art of this city.
Domenico Morelli, who has recently died,
made himself felt as an original painter with
certain claims that arrested attention. He is
not a draughtsman, but he is a colorist of passionate
intensity; he has original power and, more
than all, he has a curious endowment of what
may be called artistic clairvoyance. Transporting
himself by the magic of thought to places
on which his eye never rested, he yet sees as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in vision their special characteristics. In one
of his most important works, the motive of
which is the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness,
he has painted the desert with a startling
reality. Here is a great plain, the stony,
parched Judean plain, with the very feeling of
its desolation pervading the atmosphere. The
Royal Chapel in Naples was decorated by
Morelli, the ceiling painted with an &ldquo;Assumption
of the Virgin,&rdquo; which stands alone in all
the interpretations of this theme; not by virtue
of superior artistic excellence,&mdash;on the contrary
its art does not make a strong appeal,&mdash;but
by its originality of treatment. The
&ldquo;Salve Regina&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Da Scala d&rsquo;Oro&rdquo;
are among the more interesting works of this
artist, whose recent death has removed a figure
of exceptional character in modern art, one
who had, pre-eminently, the courage of his
convictions. Some few years ago Morelli&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Temptation of St. Anthony&rdquo; was exhibited
in both Paris and Florence, and was generally
condemned, perhaps because not wholly understood.
The form of the temptation was supposed
to be the shapes taken by a morbid and
diseased imagination; but while as a psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
conception it was not without value,
it was yet far from attractive as a work of art.
The finest conception, perhaps, ever depicted
of the temptation of St. Anthony&mdash;a subject
that has haunted many an artist&mdash;is that
painted by the late Carl Guthers of Washington,
a lofty and gifted spirit whose too brief stay
on earth ended in the early months of 1907.
In this picture the temptation of the saint
appears as a vision of all that is purest and
sweetest in life,&mdash;wife, children, home; it was
from all this peace and loveliness that St. Anthony
turned, sacrificing personal happiness to
the duty of consecrated service to his Master,
in the exquisite conception of Mr. Guthers.
Edoardo Dalbano is the typical leader of the
Neapolitan school of painting of the present
day, and his fascinating picture, called the
&ldquo;Isle of Sirens,&rdquo; representing the sirens singing
in the sunlit Bay of Naples, might well be
held as the keynote to all this enchanting
region. Surely, if the sirens sing not in those
blue waters, it were useless to search elsewhere
for them. Buono is an artist of the Neapolitan
shores, who paints its fisher-folk; Brancaccio
catches the very spirit and animated atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of the street scenes of Naples; <a name="tn237" id="tn237"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Camprani'">Campriani</ins> and
Pratello are landscapists of note; Esposito, too,
despite his Spanish name, is a Neapolitan
marine painter whose work is often most arresting
in its power to catch the flickering sunshine
over blue water that bathes the rocks
rising out of the sea,&mdash;these isles of the
sirens from which float the melodies that enchanted
Odysseus.</p>

<p>The traveller may be surprised to find that
in size Naples ranks fourth on the European
Continent,&mdash;Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg,
only, exceeding it. Naples should be, not
only a port, a pleasure haunt, and a paradise
for excursions, but one of the great cities
of the world in commercial and in social importance.
It has one of the finest natural
harbors of the world; it has a beautiful and
attractive adjoining country in which to extend,
indefinitely, its residence and trade districts;
it has the most enchanting fairyland of views
that ever were seen this side the ethereal world;
it has an atmosphere of song and story and a
climate that is far from being objectionable.
Naples is seldom the possessor of a higher
temperature in summer than is New York or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Boston; the winters are mild, and they offer
weeks of sunny loveliness when Rome is swept
by the icy tramontana from the snow-clad
Alban hills. Naples offers, too, exceedingly
good facilities for living; the groups of excellent
hotels, both on the terraces and on the water&rsquo;s
edge in the lower town and along the Villa
Nazionale, offer every comfort, and the politeness
and courtesy of the Neapolitans, as a rule,
are among the alluring features of this enchanting
city.</p>

<p>What shall be said of one hotel, especially,
perched on the cliffs, to which one ascends
by an elevator, finding it the most luxurious
fairyland that imagination can conjure? Leaving
the street one walks through a marble tunnel
lighted with electricity, wondering if he is, indeed,
in the grotto of the Muses. Entering a
&ldquo;lift&rdquo; truly American in its comfort and speed,
he is wafted up the heights and steps out in&mdash;is
it paradise? Here is a large salon entirely
of glass with an incomparable view all over
the gleaming bay, with Capri and Sorrento shining
fair on the opposite sides and Vesuvius, a
purple peak, in the near distance. The great
city of Naples lies spread out below, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
interior heights of Capodimonte and others. It
is a view for which alone one might well sail
the four thousand miles of sea from the American
shores. Through open French windows one
may step out on the terrace. If it is cold he
may still enjoy this sublimely wonderful view
behind the glass walls that reveal all its beauty
and protect him from wind or chill. Elsewhere
adjoining salons stretch away, where sunshine,
music, reading matter, and dainty writing-desks
allure the guest and create for him, indeed, an
earthly paradise.</p>

<p>Of the drive on the Strada Nuova di Posilipo,
skirting the coast while following the winding
rise of the hill, with the sumptuous villas and
gardens on one side and the blue sea on the
other,&mdash;what words can suggest its charm?
On a jutting promontory on the ruins of the
Palazzo di Donna Ana are seen the palace
whose convenient location made it possible for
the royal hosts to throw their guests into the
sea whenever they became tiresome, an accommodation
that the modern hostess might, at
times, appreciate. On this road, winding up
the Posilipo, is the villa where Garibaldi passed
the last winter of his life and which is marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
by a tablet. And everywhere and at every turn
are the beautiful views, commanding Bagnoli,
Camaldoli, Ischia, Baia and Procida, Capri,
Nisida and the Neapolitan waters. The hill
slopes are overgrown with myrtles and orange
trees and roses. Here and there a defile is
filled with a vineyard under careful culture.</p>

<p>In the presence of all this marvel of nature&rsquo;s
loveliness the visitor hardly remembers the historic
interest; yet it was on the little island of
Nisida that Brutus and Cassius concocted the
conspiracy against C√¶sar. The vast Phlegr√¶an
Plain before the eye is invested with Hellenic
traditions and is the region of many scenes in
the poems of Virgil and Homer. In the years
of the first and second centuries this plain was
dotted with the rich villas of the Roman aristocracy.
Here, too, lay the celebrated Lacus
Avernus, a volcanic lake which the ancients
regarded as the entrance to Avernus itself.
Truly it required little imagination to see here
the approach to the infernal regions. The air
was so poisonous that no bird could fly over the
lake and live. Virgil&rsquo;s scene of the descent of
√Üneas, guided by the sibyl, into the infernal
depths is laid here; and near this lake are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
resorts of the latter-day tourist, known as the
&ldquo;Sibyl&rsquo;s Grotto,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Grotto della Pace,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Bagni di Sibyl,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Inferno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Baia, on the coast, was the Newport of Rome
in the days of Augustus, Hadrian, Cicero, and
Nero. It was then the most magnificent
summer watering-place known to the world.
The glory of the Roman Empire was reflected
in the glory of Baia. In one of the Epistles of
Horace a Roman noble is made to say:
&ldquo;Nothing in the world can be compared with
the lovely bay of Baia.&rdquo; Some five hundred
years ago this region became so malarial that
no one could dwell in it. Fragments and ruins
still remain of the imposing baths and villas
of the Roman occupancy. An old crater called
the Capo Miseno is described by Virgil as the
burial place of Misenus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>At pius √Üneas ingenti mole sepulcrum</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Inponit, suaque arma viro remumque tubamque</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Dicitur aeternumque tenet per saecula nomen.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Cum√¶ was the most ancient Greek colony of
Italy on the coast, and the last survivors of the
Tarquinii died here. This is the most classic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of all these legendary coast towns near Naples,
as it was here that the Cum√¶an Sibyl dwelt
with the mysterious sibylline leaves,&mdash;the books
that were carried to Rome. A colossal Acropolis
was once here, fragments of whose walls
are now standing; and the rocky foundation is
honeycombed with secret passages and openings.
It is here that Virgil&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grotto of the
Sibyl&rdquo; is supposed to have stood,&mdash;the grotto
&ldquo;whence resound as many voices, the oracles
of the prophetess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The journey from Naples to Herculaneum is
easily made by electric train cars within an hour,
and while there is not much to see it is still an
excursion well worth making. Dr. de Petra,
of the chair of Arch√¶ology in the University
of Naples, and formerly the Director of the
National Museum, is warmly in favor of the
proposed excavation of this buried city, as is
Professor Spinazzola of the San Martino museum,
who believes that Italy may well become
one vast museum of antiquities. &ldquo;As the
theatre of Herculaneum is actually at present
a subterranean excavation,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;why
not excavate in a similar way the entire city
underneath modern Resina? In this way a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
perfectly unique underground museum would
be formed, which would have the merit of
leaving magnificent Roman art treasures exactly
in their proper places in the villas. Such a
work ought to be perfectly practicable, with
the resources of modern engineering, and would
certainly be unique in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would be no need to build a special
museum for the objects discovered. Not only
would this money be saved, but I feel convinced
that so many visitors would be attracted as to
more than pay for the maintenance. A subterraneous
Herculaneum&mdash;surely a perfectly
unique place of pilgrimage, just as it was nearly
two thousand years ago&mdash;might be lighted by
electric arc lights. I feel certain it would attract
sight-seers from the ends of the world. At the
same time work might go on in the open parts
of the city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pompeii was more of an industrial town,
while Herculaneum was a favorite resort of the
Roman patricians, who did not bring their treasures
with them from their northern homes, but
had them executed by Greek artists in the south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the mighty floods of <i>lava d&rsquo;acqua</i> that
buried Herculaneum doubtless lie temples, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
splendid forum, magnificent villas, and most
valuable art and literary treasures. In the
eighteenth century excavations brought to light
rare bronzes, mosaics, and papyri. The famous
equestrian statue of <a name="tn244a" id="tn244a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Bulbi'">Balbo</ins>, in the Naples Museum,
was excavated from Herculaneum. Professor
Lanciani and Commendatore Boni of
Rome&mdash;the latter the present director of the
Forum, <a name="tn244b" id="tn244b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'succeding'">succeeding</ins> Lanciani&mdash;believe that some
of the richest art of ancient times may be found
in Herculaneum; as does Professor Dall&rsquo;Osso,
inspector of excavations at Pompeii.</p>

<p>Herculaneum is held to have been founded
by Hercules when he landed at Campania,
returning from Iberia, some three hundred years
B.C., and it was in 63 A.D. that it was destroyed.
Of this cataclysm Pliny, the Younger,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The sea seemed to roll back on itself by the
convulsions of the earth. On the other side
hung a black and dreadful cloud, bursting with
fiery and serpentine vapors. Naught was heard
in the darkness but the shrieks of women, the
screams of children, and the frenzied cries of
men calling for children, for wives, for parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>&mdash;all
lifting hands to the gods, praying and
wishing for death.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Dr. Charles Waldstein of Cambridge University,
the eminent arch√¶ologist, whose efforts
toward initiating the excavation of Herculaneum
were a notable event of 1906, thus
writes of this buried city:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is important to bear in mind that naturally
all the best works in the Museum of Naples,
especially the bronzes, came from Herculaneum
and not from Pompeii.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is most striking is the marvellous
preservation of these works. This fact of itself
ought to counteract the strange but widespread
misapprehension that, while Pompeii was covered
with cinders and ashes, Herculaneum was
covered with lava, and that the hardness of
that material made excavation difficult, if not
impossible. All geologists and arch√¶ologists are
agreed that no lava issued from the eruption of
79 A.D. Herculaneum was covered by a torrent
of mud consisting of ashes and cinders mixed
with water. The mass which covers it, so far
from being less favorable to the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of objects, is much more favorable than that
which covers Pompeii. Pompeii was partially
covered with hot ashes and pumice stones,
which burnt or damaged the works of art. As
it was not wholly covered, moreover, the inhabitants
returned and dug up some of their
greatest treasures. Herculaneum, on the other
hand, had its actual life, arrested at the highest
point, securely preserved from depredation, to
a depth of eighty feet, by a material which preserved
intact the most delicate specimens which
have come down to us in a state so perfect as
to be really remarkable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most important of these delicate objects
are manuscripts, of which that one villa produced
1750. The state of preservation is illustrated
by one specimen, giving two pages from
the works of the philosopher Philademus. Unfortunately,
the possessor of the villa was a
specialist, a student of Epicurean philosophy.
While his taste in art was fortunately so catholic,
his taste in literature was narrowed down
by his special bent. Piso was the friend and
protector of the philosopher Philo. Already
sixty-five copies of that author&rsquo;s works have
been found among the papyri.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yet the city of Herculaneum contained many
such villas, and herein it differed from Pompeii.
Pompeii was a commonplace provincial town
devoted exclusively to commerce; it was not the
resort of wealthy and cultured Romans. It was
essentially illiterate. No manuscript can be
proved to have been found there. It is true a
wax tablet with writing has been found; yet this
contains&mdash;receipts of auctions. Herculaneum,
on the other hand, was the favorite resort of
wealthy Romans, who built beautiful villas there
as in our times people from modern Rome
settle for the summer at Sorrento and Castellammare.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The present descent into the theatre of Herculaneum
is made by a flight of more than a
hundred steps, slippery and cold, in total
darkness save for the candle that is carried by
the guide, and the visitor sees only the stone
seats of the amphitheatre and the stage with
the two vacant niches, the statues that filled
each being now placed in the Museum in
Naples.</p>

<p>The journey of thirteen miles from Naples
to Pompeii is through a succession of densely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
populated villages that seem to be an integral
part of Naples itself, for there is no line of
demarcation. Portici, Torre del Greco, Torre
dell&rsquo;Annunziata, and others all blend with each
other and with Naples. However familiar one
has become with the literature of Pompeii, with
both arch√¶ological descriptions and imaginative
interpretations in romance, and however familiar
with its aspects he may have become from replicas
in art museums, and from pictures, one can
yet hardly approach this silent, phantom city
without being thrilled by its deep significance.
At a distance of a few miles over the gently
undulating plain rises Vesuvius; one gazes on
the paths where the rivers of molten fire must
have rolled down. George S. Hillard, visiting
Pompeii in 1853, thus described a house which
the visitors of to-day study and admire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The finest house we saw within the walls
is one which had been discovered and laid bare
about four months previous to the date of our
visit, called the house of the Suonatrice, from a
painting of a female playing on a pipe, at the
entrance. This house was deemed of such
peculiar interest that it was under the charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of a special custode, and was only to be seen on
payment of an extra fee. It was not of large
size, but had evidently been occupied by a person
of ample fortune and exquisite taste. The
paintings on the walls were numerous, and in
the most perfect preservation. In the rear was
a minute garden not more than twenty or thirty
feet square, with a fairy fountain in the centre;
around which were several small statues of children
and animals, of white marble, wrought
with considerable skill. The whole thing had
a very curious effect, like the tasteful baby-house
of a grown-up child. Everything in this
house was in the most wonderful preservation.
The metal pipes which distributed the water,
and the cocks by which it was let off, looked perfectly
suited for use. Nothing at Pompeii seemed
so real as this house, and nowhere else were the
embellishments so numerous and so costly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pompeii, though a Roman city in its political
relations, was everywhere strongly marked
with the impress of the Greek mind. It stood
on the northern edge of that part of Italy which,
from the number of Grecian colonies it contained,
was called Magna Gr√¶cia,&mdash;a region of
enchanting beauty, in which the genius of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Greece attained its most luxurious development.
It has been conjectured that Pompeii had an
unusually large proportion of men of property,
who had been drawn there by the charms of its
situation and climate, and that it thus extended
a liberal patronage to Greek architects, painters,
and sculptors. At any rate, the spirit of Greece
still lives and breathes in its ashes. Its temples,
as restored by modern architects, are Greek.
Its works in marble and bronze claim a place
in that cyclus of art of which the metopes of
the Parthenon are the highest point of excellence.
The pictures that embellish the walls,
the unzoned nymphs, the bounding Bacchantes,
the grotesque Fauns, the playful arabesques,
all are informed with the airy and creative spirit
of Greek art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ruins of Pompeii are not merely an
open-air museum of curiosities, but they have
great value in the illustration they offer to Roman
history and Roman literature. The antiquarian
of our times studies the great realm of
the past with incomparable advantage, by the
help of the torch here lighted.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>From Pompeii to Castellammare, the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
seaside summer resort of the Neapolitans,
&ldquo;a lover of nature could hardly find a spot of
more varied attractions. Before him spreads
the unrivalled bay,&mdash;dotted with sails and unfolding
a broad canvas, on which the most
glowing colors and the most vivid lights are
dashed,&mdash;a mirror in which the crimson and
gold of morning, the blue of noon, and the
orange and yellow-green of sunset behold a
livelier image of themselves,&mdash;a gentle and
tideless sea, whose waves break upon the
shore like caresses, and never like angry blows.
Should he ever become weary of waves and
languish for woods, he has only to turn his
back upon the sea and climb the hills for an
hour or two, and he will find himself in the
depth of sylvan and mountain solitudes,&mdash;in
a region of vines, running streams, deep-shadowed
valleys, and broad-armed oaks,&mdash;where
he will hear the ringdove coo, and see the sensitive
hare dart across the forest aisles. A
great city is within an hour&rsquo;s reach; and the
shadow of Vesuvius hangs over the landscape,
keeping the imagination awake by touches of
mystery and terror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The road to Sorrento, on a cliff a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
feet or more above the sea, with mountains on
the other side, towering up hundreds of feet
high; a road cut in many places out of the
solid rock, supported by galleries and viaducts
from below,&mdash;a road that crosses deep gorges
and chasms, always with the iridescent colors
of the sea below,&mdash;and from Sorrento to
Amalfi again, only, if possible, even more wonderful,&mdash;is
there in the world any drive that
can rival this picturesque and sublime route?
Of it George Eliot wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is an unspeakably grand drive round the
mighty rocks with the sea below; and Amalfi
itself surpasses all imagination of a romantic
site for a city that once made itself famous
in the world.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Sorrento, with its memories and associations
of Tasso, seems a place in which one cares
only to sit on the balcony of the hotel overhanging
the sea and watch the magic spectacle
of a panorama unrivalled in all the beauty of the
world. Flowers grow in riotous profusion; the
fairy sail of a flitting boat is caught in the deepening
dusk; the dark outline of Vesuvius is seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
against the horizon; and orange orchards gleam
against gray walls. Here Tasso was born, in
1544, fit haunt for a poet, with tangles of gay
blossoms and the aerial line of mountain peaks.
A low parapet borders the precipice, and over it
one leans in the air heavy with perfume of
locust blossoms. Has the lovely town anything
beside sunsets and stars and poets&rsquo; dreams?
Who could ask for more?</p>

<p>To La Cava,&mdash;to Amalfi,&mdash;still all a dream
world!</p>

<p>If ever a region was dropped out of paradise
designed, solely, for a poet&rsquo;s day-dreams,
it is Amalfi, and the even more beautiful Ravello
just above. One fancies that it must have been
in the mystic loveliness of this eyrie that the
poet lost himself in a day-dream while Jupiter
was dividing all the goods of the world. When
he reproached the god for not saving a portion
for him, Jupiter replied that all the goods were
gone, it was true, but that his heaven was always
open to the poet.</p>

<p>The ancient Amalfi, the city of activities and
merchandise, is gone.</p>

<p>It is impossible to realize that Amalfi was
once a flourishing city of Oriental trade. One
looks in vain for any trace of ruin or shrine that
still suggests the ancient splendors of activity.
The strata of the past, so visible in other medi√¶val
cities, are not apparent here. The great
cathedral is a most interesting study in the art
of architecture,&mdash;its exquisite arcades, its delicate,
lofty campanile glittering in the sun. The
green-roofed cupola is a distinctive feature,
and up the many flights of stairs the old Capuccini
convent lies,&mdash;the unique, romantic hotel
where the cells of the monks are now the rooms
of the perpetual procession of guests. Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the wraith of Cardinal Capuano, who founded
this convent, still wander in midnight hours
through the dim cloisters? Does he still keep
watch by the body of St. Andrew, the apostle,
which he is said to have found and brought to
the cathedral where the saint lies, as a saint
should lie, gloriously entombed. St. Andrew
was the patron saint of Amalfi, but at his death
his body was carried from Patras to the Bosphorus,
where it was placed in a church in
Constantinople. The legend runs that Cardinal
Capuano, being in Constantinople, entered
the Church of the Holy Apostles to pray, and
knowing that the body of the saint was in that
city, he besought the heavenly powers to guide
him to it. Rising from his devotions he was
approached by an aged priest, who announced
to the Cardinal that the object of his search was
in that very church in which he was praying
for guidance; and, aided by unseen powers, he
was able to recover it and convey it to Amalfi.
All Italian towns that respect themselves offer
the allurement of an entombed saint and if,
occasionally, the same identical saint does duty
for more than one city, who is to decide the
local genuineness of the claim? Nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
all Italy is so curious as is this town of staircases
instead of streets; of houses perched on
the angles of impossible eyries suggesting that,
as the Venetians go about in gondolas, so the
Amalfians must have airships, or the wings of
Icarus, with which to circle in air from their
dwellings to the beach.</p>

<p>The precipitous gorges and dark ravines have
on their crests low parapets of stone walls over
which the visitor lingers and leans watching the
bluest of seas lying fair under the bluest of skies.
The main road,&mdash;there is only one,&mdash;descending
from the hill to the water&rsquo;s edge, makes its
progress through a tunnel.</p>

<p>The old Amalfi, with its palaces, its arches
and colonnades, lies under the sea. Just as the
Pensione Caterina with its rose walks and terraces
slipped into the sea in December of 1899,
when two guests and several fishermen lost
their lives, so the ancient Amalfi fell, its cliffs
swallowed up in the waters below.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hidden from all mortal eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep the sunken city lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent streets and vacant halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruined roofs and towers and walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even cities have their graves!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></div></div>

<p>When, on a May evening, the white moonlight
falls in cascades of silver sheen over terraces
and sea, with Amalfi all alabaster and
pearl like a dream city in the ethereal air;
when the stars hang low in the skies and the
fairy lights of the fishermen&rsquo;s boats twinkle far
out at sea; when the summer silence is suddenly
thrilled by the melody of Neapolitan
songs on the air, as if it were a veritable <i>chant
d&rsquo;amour</i> of sirens,&mdash;then does one believe in
the buried city. These rich baritone voices are
surely those of some singers of the buried ages.
They are floating across the centuries since
Amalfi had its pride and place among the great
centres of activity. Atrani, Amalfi&rsquo;s twin city,
lies in the adjoining defile of the mountains
which arch above them. The strange old
houses are all dazzlingly white, transfigured
under the moon to an unearthly loveliness.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the ruin of Amalfi is related by
Petrarca, who was then living in Naples. It was
in 1343 that a terrible cataclysm&mdash;an earthquake
accompanied by a tempest&mdash;caused the destruction
and the submergence of the city in the sea.</p>

<p>The believers in astrology will find their
faith re-enforced by the fact that a bishop, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was also an astrologist, had read in the stars
that in December of 1343 a terrible disaster
would occur on the Naples coast. It arrived
on schedule time. Petrarca, writing of it to
Giovanni Colonna, states that in consequence
of the prediction of the bishop, the people were
in a condition of wild terror, endeavoring to
repent of their sins and aspiring to a purer
moral life. In this tide of religious emotion,
ordinary occupations were neglected. On the
very day of the calamity people were crowding
the churches and kneeling in prayer. At night,
after the people were in bed, the shock came.
The sunset had been fair, the evening quiet,
and the people were reassured. But they were
awakened from sleep by the violence of falling
walls and the terror of the tempest. Petrarcha
was lodging in a convent, and he heard the
monks calling to one another as they rushed
from cell to cell. They hastily gathered crosses
and sacred relics in their hands, and, preceded
by the prior, sought the chapel, where they passed
the night in prayer while the tempest raged
outside. The sea broke against the rocks with
a fury that seemed to tear the very foundations
of the earth. The thunder pealed, and mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with it were the shrieks of the frightened populace.
The rain fell in torrents, deluging the city
as if the sea itself were pouring on it. When
the morning came the darkness still continued.
In the harbor broken ships crashed helplessly together.
The sands were strewn with mutilated
dead bodies. Between Capri and the shore the
sea ran mountains high. Amalfi was completely
destroyed, and has never regained her prestige.</p>

<p>The cathedral at <a name="tn260a" id="tn260a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Revello'">Ravello</ins> has traces of the
rich art it once enshrined, and the rose gardens
of the Palazzo <a name="tn260b" id="tn260b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Rufelo'">Rufolo</ins> might enchant Hafiz himself.
The terrace on the very crest of the mountain
commands one of the wonderful views of the
world. The cloistered colonnades of this old
Saracenic palace reveal views even to the plains
of P√¶stum. There are rare mosaics and fragments
of bronzes and marbles yet remaining.</p>

<p>The noble Greek ruins at P√¶stum&mdash;the three
temples&mdash;stand in all the majesty of utter desolation.
They are overgrown with flowers, however,
and they stand &ldquo;dewy in the light of the
rising dawn-star.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The shrine is ruined now, and far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To east and west stretch olive groves, whose shade,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Yet this was once a hero&rsquo;s temple, crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With myrtle boughs by lovers, and with palm<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of flute and fife in summer evening&rsquo;s calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And odorous with incense all the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nard and spice and galbanum and balm.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The detour to P√¶stum is full of significance.
The massive columns of the temples stand like
giants of the ages. &ldquo;It is difficult,&rdquo; writes John
Addington Symonds, &ldquo;not to return again and
again to the beauty of coloring at P√¶stum.
Lying basking in the sun on a flat slab of stone,
and gazing eastward, we overlook a foreground
of dappled light and shadow; then come two
stationary columns built, it seems, of solid gold,
where the sunbeams strike along their russet
surface. Between them lies the landscape, a
medley first of brakefern and asphodel and
feathering acanthus and blue spikes; while
beyond and above is a glimpse of mountains,
purple almost to indigo with cloud shadows,
and flecked with snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sail from Amalfi to P√¶stum is one incomparable
in loveliness. The sunshine is all
lurid gold. The faint, transparent blue haze
fills all the defiles of the mountains; the cliffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
disclose yawning caverns where vast clusters of
stalactites hang; and as the boat floats toward
Capri from the Sorrento promontory its rocky
headlands rise and flame into purple and rose
against the glowing sky. Across the Bay of
Naples rises the great city. It stands in some
subtle way reminding one of the scene where one</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rowing hard against the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw distant gates of Eden gleam.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Capri is the idyllic island of prismatic light
and shade, of gay and joyous life. Here Tiberius
had his summer palace, and it was from these
shores that he sent the historic letter which
revolutionized the life of Sejanus. The letter&mdash;<i>verbosa
et grandis epistola</i>&mdash;is still vivid in
the historic associations of Rome. Capri is one
of the favorite resorts both for winter and
summer. Its former modest prices are now
greatly increased, like all the latter-day expenses
of Italy; but its beauty is perennial,
and the artist and poet can still command
there a seclusion almost impossible to secure
elsewhere in Italy. The distinguished artist,
Elihu Vedder of Rome, has a country house on
Capri, and another well-known artist, Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Caryl Coleman, makes this island his home.
There are days&mdash;sometimes several days in
succession&mdash;that the sea is high and the boats
cannot run between Naples, Sorrento, and Capri;
and the enforced seclusion is still the seclusion
of the poet&rsquo;s dream. For he shares it with
Mithras, the &ldquo;unconquered god of the sun,&rdquo;
whose cult influenced all the monarchs of
Europe and who holds his court in the Grotto
de Matrimonia. Into this grotto one descends
by a flight of nearly two hundred feet; he strolls
among the ruins of the villa of Tiberius, where
the very air is still vital and vocal with those
strange and tragic chapters of Roman life.
The Emperor Augustus first founded here palaces
and aqueducts. Tiberius, who retired
to Capri in the year 27 A.D., had his architects
build twelve villas, in honor of the gods, the
largest of these being for Jupiter and known as
the Villa Jovis. In 31 A.D. occurred that
dramatic episode in Roman history, the fall of
Sejanus, and six years later Tiberius died. The
vast white marble baths he had built for him
are now submerged on the coast, and boats glide
over the spot where they stood. The Villa
Jovis stood on a cliff seven hundred feet above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the sea, and the traditions of the barbarities and
atrocities that took place there still haunt the
island. The natives apparently regard them as
a certain title to fame, but the wise tourists
persistently ignore horrors; life is made for joy,
sweetness, and charm; it is far wiser to think
on these things.</p>

<p>And there is charm and joy to spare on
lovely Capri. &ldquo;Sea-mists are frequent in the
early summer mornings, swathing the cliffs of
Capri and brooding on the smooth water till the
day wind rises,&rdquo; says John Addington Symonds.
&ldquo;Then they disappear like magic, rolling in
smoke-wreaths from the surface of the sea,
condensing into clouds and climbing the hills
like Oceanides in quest of Prometheus, or
taking their station on the watch towers of the
world as in the chorus of the Nephelai. Such
a morning may be chosen for the <i>giro</i> of the
island. The Blue Grotto loses nothing of its
beauty, but rather gains by contrast, when
passing from dense fog you find yourself transported
to a world of wavering subaqueous
sheen. It is only through the very topmost
arch that a boat can glide into this cavern;
the arch itself spreads downward through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
water so that all the light is transmitted from
beneath and colored by the sea. Outside the
magic world of pantomime there is nothing to
equal these effects of blue and silver.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Numberless are the caves at Capri. The so-called
Green Grotto has the beauty of moss
agate in its liquid floor; the Red Grotto shows
a warmer chord of color; and where there is
no other charm to notice, endless beauty may
be found in the play of sunlight upon roofs
of limestone, tinted with yellow, orange, and
pale pink, mossed over, hung with fern, and
catching tones of blue or green from the still
deeps beneath.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After a day upon the
water it is pleasant to rest at sunset in the
loggia above the sea. The Bay of Naples
stretches far and wide in front, beautiful by
reason of the long fine line descending from
Vesuvius, dipping almost to a level, and then
gliding up to join the highlands of the north.
Now sun and moon begin to mingle: waning
and waxing splendors. The cliffs above our
heads are still blushing like the heart of some
tea-rose; when lo, the touch of the huntress
is laid upon those eastern pinnacles, and the
horizon glimmers with her rising. Was it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
such a night that Ferdinand of Aragon fled
from his capital before the French, with eyes
turned ever to the land he loved, chanting,
as he leaned from his galley&rsquo;s stern, that melancholy
psalm, &lsquo;Except the Lord keep the city,
the watchman waketh but in vain,&rsquo; and seeing
Naples dwindle to a white blot on the purple
shore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The roses of Capri would form a chapter
alone. What walks there are where the air
is all fragrance of acacia and rose and orange
blossoms! Cascades of roses in riotous luxuriance
festoon the old gray stone walls; the pale
pink of the early dawn or of a shell by the seashore,
the amber of the Banskeia rose, the
great golden masses of the Mar√©chal Niel,
their faint yellow gleaming against the deep
green leaves of myrtle and frond. The intense
glowing scarlet of the gladiolus flames from
rocks and roadside, and rosemary and the purple
stars of hyacinths garland the ways, until
one feels like journeying only in his singing
robes. The deep, solemn green of stone pines
forms canopies under the sapphire skies, and
through their trunks one gazes on the sapphire
sea. Is Capri the isle of Epipsychidion?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Monte Cassino is one of the most interesting
inland points in Southern Italy,&mdash;the monastery
lying on the crest of a hill nearly two
thousand feet above the sea. Dante alludes
to this in his Paradiso (XXII, XXXVII), and
in the prose translation made by that eminent
Dantean scholar, Professor Charles Eliot
Norton, this assurance of Beatrice to Dante is
thus rendered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;That mountain on whose slope Cassino is,
was of old frequented on its summit by the
deluded and ill-disposed people, and I am he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
who first carried up thither the name of Him
who brought to earth the truth which so high
exalts us; and such grace shone upon me that
I drew away the surrounding villages from the
impious worship which seduced the world.
Those other fires were all contemplative men,
kindled by that heat which brings to birth holy
flowers and fruits. Here is Macarius, here is
Romuald, here are my brothers, who within the
cloisters fixed their feet, and held a steadfast
heart. And I to him, &lsquo;The affection which
thou displayest in speaking with me, and the
good semblance which I see and note in all
your ardors, have so expanded my confidence
as the sun does the rose, when she becomes
open so much as she has power to be. Therefore
I pray thee, and do thou, father, assure me
if I have power to receive so much grace,
that I may see thee with uncovered shape.&rsquo;
Whereon he, &lsquo;Brother, thy high desire shall be
fulfilled in the last sphere, where are fulfilled
all others and my own. There perfect, mature,
and whole is every desire; in that alone is every
part there where it always was: for it is not in
space, and hath not poles; and our stairway
reaches up to it, wherefore thus from thy sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
it conceals itself. Far up as there the patriarch
Jacob saw it stretch its topmost part when
it appeared to him so laden with Angels. But
now no one lifts his feet from earth to ascend it;
and my rule is remaining as waste of paper.
The walls, which used to be an abbey, have
become caves; and the cowls are sacks full of
bad meal. But heavy usury is not gathered in
so greatly against the pleasure of God, as that
fruit which makes the heart of monks so foolish.
For whatsoever the Church guards is all for the
folk that ask it in God&rsquo;s name, not for one&rsquo;s
kindred, or for another more vile. The flesh
of mortals is so soft that a good beginning
suffices not below from the springing of the oak
to the forming of the acorn. Peter began without
gold and without silver, and I with prayers
and with fasting, and Francis in humility his
convent; and if thou lookest at the source of
each, and then lookest again whither it has run,
thou wilt see dark made of the white. Truly,
Jordan turned back, and the sea fleeing when
God willed, were more marvellous to behold
than succor here.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Dante adds that the company &ldquo;like a whirlwind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
gathered itself upward,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the
sweet lady urged me behind them, with only
a sign, up over that stairway; so did her virtue
overcome my nature. But never here below,
where one mounts and descends naturally,
was there motion so rapid that it could be
compared unto my wing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The time was when Dante and Beatrice met,
and he &ldquo;was standing as one who within himself
represses the point of his desire, and attempts
not to ask, he so fears the too-much.&rdquo; And
then he heard: &ldquo;If thou couldst see, as I do,
the charity which burns among us thy thoughts
would be expressed. But that thou through
waiting mayst not delay thy high end, I will
make answer to thee, even to the thought concerning
which thou art so regardful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vast monastery of Monte Cassino, lying
on the crest of a hill nearly two thousand feet
above the sea, has one of the most magnificent
locations in all Italy. This monastery was
founded (in 529 A.D.) by St. Benedict, on the
site of an ancient temple to Apollo. Dante alludes
to this also in the Paradiso (Canto XX, 11).
As seen from below this monastery has the
appearance of a vast castle, or fortress. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
location is one of the most magnificent in all
Italy. The old entrance was a curious passage
cut through solid rock and it is still used for
princes and cardinals&mdash;no lesser dignitaries being
allowed to pass through it&mdash;and within
the past thirty years a new entrance has been
constructed. In the passageway of the medi√¶val
entrance St. Benedict is said to have had his
cell, and of recent years the German Benedictines,
believing they had located the original cell,
had it located, restored, and decorated with
Egyptian frescoes. Several of the courts of this
convent are connected by beautiful arcades with
lofty arches, and adorned with statues, among
which are those of St. Benedict and his sister,
St. Scholastica. Still farther up the hill, upon
the monastery, stands the church which is built
on the site of the ancient one that was erected
by St. Benedict himself&mdash;this present edifice
dating back to 1637. Above the portals there
is a long inscription in Latin relating the history
of the monastery and the church. These portals
are solid bronze, beautifully carved, with
inlaid tablets of silver on which are inscribed a
list of all the treasures of the abbey in the year
1006. The church is very rich in interior decoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of mosaics, rare marbles, and wonderful
monumental memorials. Either side of the
high altar are monuments to the Prince of
Mignano <a name="tn272a" id="tn272a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Ginodone Trieramosca'">(Guidone Fieramosca)</ins> and also to
Piero de Medico. Both St. Benedict and his
sister, St. Scholastica, are entombed under the
high altar, which is one of the most elaborately
sculptured in all the churches of Italy.</p>

<p>Among the pictorial decorations of this church
are a series of fresco paintings by Luca <a name="tn272b" id="tn272b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Gindano'">Giordano</ins>,
painted in the seventeenth century, representing
the miracles wrought by St. Benedict. In the
refectory is the &ldquo;Miracle of the Loaves,&rdquo; by
Bassano; and in the chapel below are paintings
by <a name="tn272c" id="tn272c"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Mazzarappi'">Mazzaroppi</ins> and Marco da Siena. Nothing
can exceed the richness and beauty of the carvings
of the choir stalls. These were executed
in the seventeenth century by Coliccio.</p>

<p>The library of this monastery is renowned
all over Europe&mdash;indeed, it is famous all over
the world&mdash;for its preservation of ancient
manuscripts done by the monks. These are
carefully treasured in the archives. Among
them is the record of a vision that came to the
monk Alferic, in the twelfth century, on which
it is believed that Dante founded his immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
&ldquo;Divina Commedia;&rdquo; there is also a fourteenth-century
edition of Dante with margined notes;
and the Commentary of Origen (on the Epistle
to the Romans), dating back to the sixteenth
century; there is the complete series of Papal
bulls that were sent to the monastery of Monte
Cassino from the eleventh century to the
present time, many of them being richly illuminated
and decorated with curiously elaborate
seals. There is an autograph letter of the Sultan
Mohammed II to Pope Nicholas IV, with
the Pope&rsquo;s reply,&mdash;the theme of the correspondence
being the Pope&rsquo;s threat of war. The
imperial Mohammed seems to have been in
terror of this, and in his epistle he expresses
his willingness, and, indeed, his intention, to
be converted as soon as he shall visit Rome!
Apparently the Holy Father of that day laid
little stress on the sincerity of this offer on the
part of the Sultan. Here, too, is a wonderful
correspondence between Don Erasmo Gattola,
the historian of the abbey, and a great number
of the celebrated men of his time; and there
are hundreds of other letters, manuscripts, and
documents relating to kings, nobles, emperors,
and many of the nobility of the age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>In this monastery there is a most interesting
collection of relics, in bronze, silver, gold, and
<i>rosso antico</i>. The library proper contains some
eleven thousand volumes, dating back to the
very dawn of the discovery of the art of printing.</p>

<p>Mr. Longfellow, whose poet&rsquo;s pen has pictured
so many of the Italian landscapes and
ancient monuments, thus set Monte Cassino
to music, picturing the entire landscape of the

<p>The monastery of Monte Cassino entertains,
as its guests, for dinner or for a night, all
gentlemen who visit it; but there is an alms
box on the ancient gate into which the guest
is supposed to place whatever contribution he
pleases for the poor of the place. The Italian
government, in 1866, declared this monastery
to be a &ldquo;Monumento <a name="tn276" id="tn276"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Nazionali'">Nazionale</ins>,&rdquo; and it is now
a famous ecclesiastical school with some two
hundred students and a resplendent faculty of
fifty learned monks under the direction of the
Abbot. Some of the most celebrated prelates
in Europe have been educated at Monte Cassino.</p>

<p>Quite near Monte Cassino, as Longfellow
depicts in his lines, is Monte Aquino, a picturesque
hillside where the &ldquo;Doctor Angelicus,&rdquo;
Thomas Aquinas, was born (in 1224), the
son of Count Landulf, in the Castel Roccasecca.
He was educated in the monastery, and
one finds himself recalling here these lines of
Thomas William Parsons, entitled &ldquo;Turning
from Darwin to Thomas Aquinas:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">But a true temple where Christ&rsquo;s word could grow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was at Aquinum, too, at the foot of Monte
Aquino, Juvenal was born. Near the peaks of
Monte Cassino and Monte Aquino is that of
Monte Cairo, five thousand five hundred feet
high, from whose summit one of the finest
views of all southern Europe is attained. The
Gulf of Gaeta, the valley of San Germano, the
wild and romantic mountain region of the
Abruzzi and a view, too, of the blue sea are in
the panorama, bathed in the opalescent, gleaming
lights that often invest the Italian landscape
with jewelled splendor.</p>

a rush of romantic impressions as if one were
transported into ideal regions of song, before
this impression begins to resolve itself into definite
remembrance of fact and incident. Surely
some exquisite associations in the past had enchanted
this island in memory and invested it

scholar and savant and princes of the church;
of a court of nobility enriched and adorned by
prelate and by poet; traditions, too, of a woman&rsquo;s
consecration to an immortal love and the solace
of grief by poetic genius and exalted friendships,&mdash;all

vague, atmospheric way till memory, still groping
backward in the twilight of the richly historic

that it was Ischia which was the home of Vittoria

<p>Vittoria Colonna was called the most beautiful
and gifted woman of her time in all Italy. Her
life of nearly sixty years (1490-1547) lay entirely
in that period when the apathy of ten centuries
was broken, when the darkness fled before
the dawning of a glorious day. New methods
of thought, revised taste in poetry, new discoveries
of science, a nobler progress in criticism,
great discoveries, and a lofty and unprecedented
freedom of conviction marked the century
between 1450 and 1550, stamping it as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
marvellous time which we know as the Renaissance,
&ldquo;that solemn fifteenth century which
can hardly be studied too much, not merely for
its positive results in the things of the intellect
and the imagination, its concrete works of art,
its special and prominent personalities, with their
profound √¶sthetic charm, but for its general
spirit and character, for the ethical qualities of
which it is a consummate type.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was peculiarly fitting that Italy should take
the initiative in inaugurating this <i>vita nuova</i>.
Italy had a language and literature and art.
Dante had delivered his solemn message and
Petrarca his impassioned song. Boccaccio had
taught the gospel of gladness. Who shall
analyze the secret springs of their inspiration
and reveal to what degree Ovid and Horace and
Virgil influenced the later literature? A new
solar system was established by Copernicus.
America was discovered. Science entered on
her definite and ceaseless progress, and religion
and art became significant forces in human life.
Printing had been invented and the compass
discovered.</p>

<p>Into this time of new forces, when everything
was throbbing and pulsating with life, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Vittoria Colonna born into social prestige and
splendor. Her father, Fabrizio Colonna, and
her mother, Agnesina di Montefeltro, a daughter
of the Duke of Urbino, were then domiciled in
the castle of Marino, on the Lago d&rsquo;Albano,
a magnificent palace some twelve miles from
Rome, in which the Duke d&rsquo;Amalfi (the father
of Fabrizio Colonna) lived, and which is still
standing, filled with memorials and relics of
historic interest. Urbino, the seat of the Montefeltro,
is renowned as having been the birthplace
of Raphael, who</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Only drank the precious wine of youth,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">but who</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lives immortal in the hearts of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the world is fairer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he lived in it.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Colonna date back to the eleventh
century, and they gave many princes and cardinals
to the country. At the close of the thirteenth
century they were arrayed against Boniface
VIII, the Pope, who accused them of crime,
while they disputed the validity of his election
to the holy office. In retaliation, the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
excommunicated the entire family, anathematized
them as heretics and declared their estates
forfeited to the church. The Colonna, far
from being intimidated, commanded three hundred
armed horsemen, attacked the papal
palace, which they plundered, and made him a
prisoner,&mdash;an incident referred to by Dante
in the &ldquo;Inferno.&rdquo; The Colonna and the <a name="tn286a" id="tn286a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Orsino'">Orsini</ins>
were also at warfare, and when a member of
the former family was elevated to the papacy
under the name of Martin V, they despoiled
property of the Orsini.</p>

<p>Gay excursionists to-day, who fly over the
Campagna in their twentieth-century touring
cars to the lovely towns of the Alban hills, may
look down from Castel <a name="tn286b" id="tn286b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Gondolfo'">Gandolfo</ins> on the gloomy,
medi√¶val little town of Marino, part way up
a steep hillside, whose summit is crowned by
the castle once belonging to the Colonna and
in which Vittoria passed her early childhood.
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; in his &ldquo;Roba di Roma,&rdquo; says Story,
&ldquo;can be more rich and varied than this magnificent
amphitheatre of the Campagna of Rome,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sometimes drear, mysterious, and melancholy
in desolate stretches; sometimes rolling
like an inland sea whose waves have suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
become green with grass, golden with grain, and
gracious with myriads of wild flowers, where
scarlet poppies blaze and pink daisies cover
vast meadows and vines shroud the picturesque
ruins of antique villas, aqueducts, and tombs,
or drop from medi√¶val towers and fortresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flying in the swift motor-car of the time
toward the Alban hills, Marino may be easily
reached in less than an hour from the Porta
San Giovanni, and in the near distance Monte
Albani, rising into the cone of Monte Cavi,
is a picture before the eye, while on the lower
slopes gleam the white villages of Albani,
Marino, Castel <a name="tn287" id="tn287"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Gondolfo'">Gandolfo</ins>, and Frascati, with
the campanile of a cathedral, a fortress-like
ruin, or gardens and olive orchards clambering
up the heights. The Papal town of Rocca di
Papa crowns one summit where once Tarquin&rsquo;s
temple to Jupiter stood and on whose ruins
now gleam afar in the Italian sunshine the
white walls of the Passionist convent of Monte
Cavi, built by Cardinal York. From this height
Juno gazed upon the great conflict of contending
armies, if Virgil&rsquo;s topography be entitled
to authority. And here, through a defile in
the hills, one may look toward Naples, &ldquo;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
then rising abruptly with sheer limestone cliffs
and crevasses, where transparent purple shadows
sleep all day long, towers the grand range of the
Sabine mountains, whose lofty peaks surround
the Campagna to the east and north like a
curved amphitheatre.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Again, skirting the
Pontine Marshes on the east, are the Volscian
mountains, closing up the Campagna at Terracina,
where they overhang the road and
affront the sea with their great barrier. Following
along the Sabine hills, you will see at
intervals the towns of Palestrina and Tivoli,
where the Anio tumbles in foam, and other little
mountain towns nestled here and there among
the soft airy hollows, or perched on the cliffs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this landscape there are three ruined
villages&mdash;Colonna, Gallicano, and Zagarda&mdash;perched
on their respective hills. The castle
of the Colonna family is now restored and
modernized to a degree that leaves little trace
of that former stately grandeur which is transmuted
into modern convenience and comfort.</p>

<p>In this scene of romantic beauty, with the
vista of beauty almost incomparable in any
inland view in Italy, Vittoria passed her infancy,
until, at the age of four, her childhood was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
transplanted to fairy Ischia. In all this chain
of Alban towns, including Marino, Viterbo, Ariccia,
and Rocca di Papa, the great family of the
Colonna owned extensive estates, each crowning
some height, while the defiles between were
filled, then as now, with the foam and blossom
of riotous greenery. Then, as now, across the
mystic Campagna, the dome of St. Peter&rsquo;s silhouetted
itself against a golden background of
western sky.</p>

<p>One needs not to have had privileged access
to the sibylline leaves of the Cum√¶an soothsayer
to recognize that Vittoria Colonna was
born under the star of destiny. Her horoscope
seemed to be inextricably entwined with that of
Italy; and the events which created and determined
the conditions of her life and its panoramic
series of circumstances were the events
of Italy and of Europe as well&mdash;in political
aspects and in the influence on general progress,
brought to bear by strong and prominent individualities
whose gifts, genius, or force dominated
the movements of the day.</p>

<p>To her father&rsquo;s change of political allegiance,
from the French to the Spanish side, in the
war raging between those countries in 1494,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Vittoria owed all her life in Ischia; and her
marriage, and all that resulted from her becoming
a member of the d&rsquo;Avalos family, was due
to this espousal of a new political faith on the
part of Fabrizio Colonna. To the fact that in
1425 the war with France again broke out was
due the loss of her husband and the conditions
that consecrated her life to poetry, to learning,
and that made possible the beautiful and sympathetic
friendship between herself and Michael
Angelo. Her life presents the most forcible
illustration of the overruling power on human
life and destiny.</p>

<p>It was the political change of faith on the
part of Fabrizio Colonna that initiated an unforeseen
and undreamed-of drama of life for his
infant daughter, the first act of which included
the command of the King of Naples that the
little Vittoria should be betrothed to Francesco
d&rsquo;Avalos, the son of Alphonso, Marchese di
Pescara, of Ischia, one of the nobles who stood
nearest to the king in those troubled days.
Francesco was born in the castle on Ischia in
1489, and was one year older than Vittoria.
Fabrizio exchanged his castle at Marino for
one in Naples, which city made him the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Constable. The d&rsquo;Avalos castle in Ischia had
at this time for its chatelaine the Duchessa di
Francavilla, who is said by some authorities
to have been the elder sister and by others to
have been the aunt of Francesco. Donna Constanza
d&rsquo;Avalos, later the Duchessa di Francavilla,
had been made the Castellana of the
island for her courage in refusing to capitulate
to the French troops when, after the death of
her father, she was left in sole charge of the
d&rsquo;Avalos estates, and Emperor Charles V elevated
her rank to that of Principessa. The
Duchessa was one of the most remarkable
women of the day. She was a classical scholar,
and herself a writer, the author of a book entitled
&ldquo;<i>Degli Infortuni e Travagli del Mondo</i>.&rdquo;
To the care of this learned and brilliant woman,
a great lady in the social life of the time, the
care of the little Vittoria was committed, and
she studied and played and grew up with
Francesco, her future husband. The d&rsquo;Avalos
family ranked among the highest nobility of
the Court of Naples, and the Principessa reigned
as a queen of letters and society in her island
kingdom. It was under her care that the two
children, Francesco and Vittoria, pursued their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
studies together and acquired every grace of
scholarship and accomplishment of society. The
circles which the Duchessa drew around her
included many gentlewomen from Sicily and
from Naples; and &ldquo;the life at Castel d&rsquo;Ischia
was synonymous with everything glorious and
elegant,&rdquo; recorded Visconti, &ldquo;and its fame has
been immortalized.&rdquo; Although Francesco (the
future Marchese di Pescara) was born in Italian
dominions, yet the d&rsquo;Avalos family were of
Spanish ancestry and traditions. The musical
Castilian was the language of the household.
The race ideals of Spain&mdash;the poetic, the impassioned,
the joy in color and movement&mdash;pervaded
the very atmosphere of Castel d&rsquo;Ischia.
Vittoria&rsquo;s earliest girlhood revealed her exceptional
beauty and charm, and gave evidence
that the gods loved her and had dowered her
with their immortal gifts and genius, which
flowered, under the sympathetic guidance and
stimulus of such a woman as the Principessa
(the Duchessa di Francavilla) and the society
she drew around her, as the orange and the
myrtle flower under the southern sunshine.</p>

<p>The literature of biography presents no chapter
that can rival this in the idyllic beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the lives of those two children on the lovely
island in the violet sea. The perpetual conflicts
that were waged in both Rome and Naples
awakened no echoes in this romantic and
isolated spot, whose atmosphere was that of
the peace of scholarly pursuits and lofty thought
that is found where the arts and the muses
hold their sway.</p>

<p>But in 1496 came the tragedy of the death
of the young king and queen of Naples; four
years later Rome celebrated a jubilee in which
Naples took part, sending a splendid procession
as escort to the famous Madonna that was
carried from Naples to Rome and back, working
miracles, it is said, on both journeys, as a
Madonna should. A year later Frederick of
Naples and the queen, and two of the king&rsquo;s
sisters,&mdash;ladies of high nobility,&mdash;came as
guests to the castle in Ischia,&mdash;royal exiles
seeking shelter. Five years later the new king
and queen were welcomed with gorgeous parade
and acclamation. A pier was thrown out over
one hundred feet into the sea; on this a tent of
gold was erected, and all the nobility of Naples,
in the richest costumes of velvet and jewels,
thronged to meet the royal guests. Over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
sunlit Bay of Naples resounded the thunder of
the guns in military salute and the cheers of
the people. Among the distinguished nobility
present, Costanza, Duchessa and Principessa
di Francavilla, was a marked figure with her
young charge, Vittoria Colonna, at her side.
She made a deep reverence and kissed the hand
of the king as he passed, as did many of the
ladies of highest rank, and at the f√™te of that
evening Vittoria&rsquo;s beauty charmed all eyes.
Although it was well understood that she had
been betrothed since childhood to Francesco
d&rsquo;Avalos, yet many princes and nobles sued
for her hand and were refused by her father,
who was at this time established magnificently
in Naples. Pope Julius II refused the pleadings
of two dukes, both of whom wished to seek
Vittoria in marriage, as he considered the love
of the young girl for her betrothed a matter to
be held sacred. Three years later, when Vittoria
was nineteen and Francesco twenty, their
marriage was celebrated in Castel d&rsquo;Ischia with
the richest state and beauty of ceremonial
observance. A few months previous to this
time she had returned to her father&rsquo;s country
home in the family castle at Marino, whither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
both Fabrizio and Agnese Colonna accompanied
their daughter. When the time appointed for
her bridal came, Vittoria was escorted to Ischia
by princes, and dukes, and ladies of honor, and
the marriage gifts to the bride included a chain
of rubies, diamonds, and emeralds, linked with
gold; a writing desk of solid gold; wonderful
bracelets; costumes of velvets, and brocades and
rich embroideries, and a portion of fourteen
thousand ducats.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;The noted pair had not their equals in Italy
at this time,&rdquo; writes a contemporary historian.
&ldquo;Their life in Naples was all magnificence and
festivity, and when they desired to exchange it
for the country they left Naples for <a name="tn295a" id="tn295a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Pietzalba'">Pietralba</ins>
on Monte Emo, where they assembled pleasant
parties of ladies and gentlemen. Much time
was passed in their beloved Ischia, where the
Duchessa, as Castellana, was obliged to receive
much company. And here were found the
flower of chivalry and the men most noted in
letters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They listened to the poets Sanazzaro,
il Rota, and Bernardo Tasso; or they
heard the admirable discourses on letters of
Musefico, il <a name="tn295b" id="tn295b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Givoio, and il Minturo'">Giovio, and il Minturno</ins>. It was an
agreeable school for the youthful minds of Vittoria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and Pescara. Thus passed in great happiness
the first three years of their married life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not strange that to the young Marchesa
di Pescara, Ischia had become an enchanted
island. The scene of her happy childhood, of
her studies, of her first efforts in lyric art, of
her stately and resplendent bridal; the home,
too, of her early married life,&mdash;it is little
wonder that in after years she translated into
song its scenic loveliness and the thoughts and
visions it had inspired.</p>

<p>Again, the ever-recurring war came on, and
in the spring of 1512 the King of Naples conferred
the doubtful privilege on the Marchesa
di Pescara of serving as the royal representative.
It is said that Vittoria personally superintended
her young husband&rsquo;s outfit,&mdash;in horses, attendants,
armor, and other details belonging to
a gentleman of rank. Her father and her uncle,
Prospero Colonna, were also among the military
who led Italian troops. In the terrible battle
of Ravenna (which was fought on the Easter
Sunday, April 11, of 1512), Pescara was wounded,
taken prisoner, and carried to the fortress of
Porta Gobbia. A messenger was sent to Ischia,
where Vittoria lived between her books and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
orange groves; and the twentieth-century cynic
of 1907 will smile at the form in which she
expressed her sorrow,&mdash;that of a poem of
some forty stanzas, which began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Eccelso Mio Signor! Questa ti scrivo</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Per te narrar <a name="tn297a" id="tn297a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'tre'">tra</ins> quante dubbie voglie,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fra quanti aspri martir, <a name="tn297b" id="tn297b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'degliosa'">dogliosa</ins> io vivo!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A translation of this lyric epistle, made in
prose, gives it more fully as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Eccelso Mio Signor: I write this to thee to
tell thee amid what bitter anxieties I live.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I believed that so many prayers and tears, and
love without measure, would not have been
displeasing to God.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thy great valor has
shone as in a Hector or an Achilles.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In this letter Vittoria tells him that when
the messenger reached her, she was lying on
a point of the island (&ldquo;<i>I</i>, in the <i>body</i>, my <i>mind</i>
always with <i>thee</i>,&rdquo; she says), and that the whole
atmosphere had been to her that day &ldquo;like a
cavern of black fog,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the marine
gods seemed to say to Ischia, &lsquo;To-day, Vittoria,
thou shalt hear of disgrace from the confines:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
thou now in health and honor, thou shalt be
turned to grief; but thy father and husband are
saved, though taken prisoners.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This presentiment she related to her husband&rsquo;s
aunt, the Duchessa Francavilla, the
Castellana of Ischia, who begged her not to
think of it and said, &ldquo;It would be strange for
such a force to be conquered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just after this conversation between the
youthful Marchesa and the Duchessa, the
messenger arrived. The psychic science of
to-day would see in this occurrence a striking
instance of telepathy. In her poetic epistle
to her husband, Vittoria also says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;A wife ought to follow her husband at home
and abroad; if he suffers trouble, she suffers;
if he is happy, she is; if he dies, she dies. What
happens to one happens to both; equals in
life, they are equals in death. His fate is her
fate.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>These letters&mdash;in keeping with the times&mdash;were,
on both sides, expressed in literary rather
than in personal form. Pescara, from his captivity,
wrote to her a &ldquo;Dialogue on Love,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>&mdash;a
manuscript for which Visconti notes that he
has searched in vain.</p>

<p>The Marchesa di Pescara went from Ischia
to Naples, after learning of the misfortunes
that had overtaken her husband, in order that
she might be able constantly to receive direct
communication regarding his fate. A few
months later the Marchese returned, making
the day &ldquo;brilliant with joy&rdquo; to Vittoria, but after
a year of happiness he was again called to service,
and the Marchesa returned to her beloved
Ischia. She gave herself to the study of the
ancient classics; she wrote poems, and &ldquo;considered
no time of value but so spent,&rdquo; says
Rota. The age was one of a general revival
of learning. Royalty, the Pope, the princes
and nobility were all giving themselves with
ardor to this higher culture. Under Dante the
Italian language assumed new perfection. This
period was to Vittoria one of intense stimulus,
and it must have had a formative influence on
her gifts and her mental power. Having no
children, she adopted a young cousin of her
husband, the Marchese del Vasto, to educate
and to be the heir of their estates. In 1515,
Pescara again returned and the entire island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of Ischia was &ldquo;aflame with bonfires, and the
borders of the beautiful shore bright and warm
with lights,&rdquo; in honor of the event. Of this
event, Vittoria wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My beloved returns to us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his
countenance radiant with piety to God, with
deeds born of inward faith.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>At a magnificent wedding festival in the
d&rsquo;Avalos family about this time, it is recorded
that the Marchesa di Pescara &ldquo;wore a robe of
brocaded crimson velvet, with large branches of
beaten gold wrought on it, with a headdress of
wrought gold and a girdle of beaten gold around
her waist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the coronation of Charles V was to be
celebrated at Aix-la-Chapelle the Marchese di
Pescara was appointed ambassador to represent
the House of Aragon on this brilliant occasion,
when the new emperor was to be invested with
the crown and the sceptre of Charlemagne.
Charles had decided to journey by sea and to
visit Henry VIII on the way, an arrangement
of which Cardinal Wolsey was aware, although
he had kept Henry in ignorance of it, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
to those curious mental processes of his mind
where his young monarch was concerned.
Shakespeare, in the play of &ldquo;King Henry VIII,&rdquo;
describes the meeting of the two kings, which
occurred at Canterbury, &ldquo;at a grand jubilee in
honor of the shrine of Thomas √† Becket.&rdquo;
One historian thus describes this scene:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The two handsome young sovereigns rode
into Canterbury under the same canopy, the
great Cardinal riding directly in front of them,
and on the right and left were the proud nobles
of Spain and England, among whom was Pescara.
The kings alighted from their horses at
the west door of the cathedral and together
paid their devotions before that rich shrine
blazing with jewels. They humbly knelt on
the steps worn by the knees of tens of thousands
of pilgrims.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>On the return to Naples of the Marchese di
Pescara he told the story of his regal journey
to an assemblage of nobles in the Church of
Santa Maria di Monte Oliveto, and he then
joined the Marchesa in Rome, where she had
gone to visit her family and to pay her devotions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to Leo X, who had just created Pompeo
Colonna a cardinal.</p>

<p>Pope Leo aspired to draw around him a
court distinguished for its culture and brilliancy
in both art and literature. In this court
the Marchesa di Pescara shone resplendent.
&ldquo;She was at the height of her beauty, and her
charms were sung by the poets of the day,&rdquo;
says a contemporary.</p>

<p>A year later Leo X died, succeeded by Adrian
(who had been tutor to Charles V), to the
intense and bitter disappointment of Cardinal
Wolsey, who had made the widest&mdash;and wiliest&mdash;efforts
to gratify his own ambition of reigning
in the Papal chair. Again the war between
France and Italy, that which seemed to be a
perpetually smouldering feud, and the Marchese
di Pescara, again summoned to battle,
was wounded at Pavia. For some time he lay
between life and death at Milan, and a messenger
was sent to beg Vittoria to come to him.
She set out on this journey, leaving Naples in
great haste; but on reaching Viterbo another
messenger met her with the tidings of the death
of the Marchese, which had occurred on Nov. 25,
1525. Overcome with grief, Vittoria was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
back to Rome and for the solace of entire
seclusion she sought the cloistered silence of
the convent of San Silvestre, which lay at the
foot of the Monte Cavallo in Rome, almost
adjoining the gardens of the Colonna palace.
To the Marchese di Pescara, who had the military
rank of general, was given a funeral of great
pomp and splendor in Milan, and his body was
brought to the famous Naples church of Santa
Domenica Maggiore, where it was entombed
with the princes and nobles of his house.</p>

<p>Before the death of the Marchese there had
been a political plot to join the Papal, Venetian,
and Milanese forces and rescue Italy from the
Emperor&rsquo;s rule, and the Pope himself had sent
a messenger to Pescara asking him to unite
with the league. The Marchese, Spanish by
ancestry and by sympathies, used this knowledge
to frustrate the Italian designs and to
warn Spain. The Italian historians have execrated
him for this act, which they regard as
that of a traitor. Vittoria, however, did not
take this view apparently, as in a letter to her
husband she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Titles and kingdoms do not add to true
honor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not desire to be the wife of
a king, but I glory in being the wife of that
great general who shows his bravery in war
and, still more, by magnanimity in peace, surpasses
the greatest kings.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The inducement of the throne of Naples had
been held out to Marchese di Pescara. He
evidently regarded this in the nature of a dishonorable
bribe, and it is this view which the
Marchesa plainly shared.</p>

<p>After his death her first impulse was to take
the vows of a cloistered nun. The Pope himself
intervened to dissuade her, and she consented
to enter, only temporarily, the convent
of San Silvestre on the Monte Cavallo.</p>

<p>In the will of the Marchese di Pescara there
was a clause directing that anything in his
estate unlawfully acquired should be restored
to the owner; and under this, Vittoria gave back
to the monastery of Monte Cassino the Monte
San <a name="tn304" id="tn304"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Mano'">Magno</ins> that had formerly been its property.</p>

<p>From the cloistered shades of the convent
Vittoria removed to the family castle of the
Colonna at Marino, where, on the shore of this
beautiful lake (which was the scenery of Virgil&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
√Üneid), she passed some months, engaged
in writing sonnets. Of one of these a translation
runs in part:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I write solely to assuage my inward grief,
which destroys in my heart the light of this
world&rsquo;s sun; and not to add light to <i>mio <a name="tn305" id="tn305"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'vel solo'">bel
sole</ins></i>, to his glorified spirit. It is fit that other
tongues should preserve his great name from
oblivion.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In another, perhaps her most perfect sonnet,
she beseeches the winds to convey to her beloved
the message she sends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<i>Ch&rsquo;io di lui sempre pensi; o pianga, o parli</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;That
I always think of him, or weep for him,
or speak of him.</p></div>

<p>Again, a year later, Vittoria returned to
lovely Ischia, which, as one writer has described,
&ldquo;rises out of the blue billows of the Mediterranean
like giant towers. The immense blocks
of stone are heaped one upon another, in such
a supernatural manner as to give a coloring to
the legend, that beneath them, in those vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
volcanic caverns, dwells the giant Tifeo.&rdquo; The
castle where the Duchessa Francavilla and the
Marchesa Pescara lived is built on a towering
mass of rock joined to the island by a causeway.
The castle includes the palace, a church,
and other buildings for the family and their
guests and dependants.</p>

<p>For some three years the Marchesa did not
again leave Ischia. In the mean time volumes
of her poems were published. She received the
acclamation of all the writers of her time. The
crown of immortelles, often laid but on a tomb,
was continually pressed upon her brow. She
was the most famous woman of her time. Her
beauty, her genius, her noble majesty of character
impressed the contemporary world. Her
days were filled with correspondence with the
most distinguished men of the day. Ariosto,
Castiglione, Ludovico Dolce, Cardinal Bembo,

<p>Stormy times fell upon Italy, in all of which
the Colonna family bore prominent part, and
all of which affected the life of Vittoria Colonna
in many ways. Her biography, if written with
fulness and accuracy, would be largely a history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the Italy of that time, for her life seemed
always inseparably united with great events.</p>

<p>In the year 1530 (Clement VII being the
Pope) a full Papal pardon had been extended
to all the Colonna, and their castles and estates
had also been restored to them. For years past
Rome had been in a state of conflict. Benvenuto
Cellini, who had watched the terrible
scenes from Castel San Angelo where he was
immured, has described the terrors. The Eternal
City, whose population under Leo X had
been 90,000, was now&mdash;in 1530&mdash;reduced to
half that number. Palaces and temples had
been the scenes of riot and destruction, yet to
this very lawlessness of the time the Roman
galleries of the present owe their ancient statues,
which were uncovered by these assaults. The
Coliseum was left in the ruined state in which
it is now seen, and by the sale of the stones
taken from it the Palazzo Barberini was
erected.</p>

<p>Vittoria, coming again to Rome and revisiting
its classic greatness, exclaimed that happy
were they who lived in times so full of grandeur;
to which the poet Molza gallantly replied that
they were less happy, as they had not known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
her! Everywhere was she received with the
highest honors. She made a tour, visiting
Bagni di Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara, where
she was the guest of the Duca and Duchessa
Ercole in the ducal palace. The Duchessa was
the Princesse Ren√©e, the daughter of Louis XII
of France, and an ardent friend of Calvin, who
visited her in Ferrara. It was to this visit that
Longfellow refers in his poem entitled &ldquo;Michael
Angelo,&rdquo; when he pictures Vittoria as sitting
for her portrait to the artist and conversing with
her friend Giulia, the Duchess of Trajetto,
Michael Angelo begs them to resume the conversation
interrupted by his entrance, and
Vittoria says:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Duca and Duchessa of Ferrara invited
the most distinguished persons in Venice and
Bologna and Lombardy to meet their honored
guest. Bishop Ghiberto of Verona besought
her to visit that city. Vittoria accepted and
was for some time the Bishop&rsquo;s guest in his
palace, and she took great interest in the historic
city. With the Bishop she visited the ancient
Duomo, which in 1160 had been restored by Pope
Urban II, and reconsecrated. It was a strong
desire of the Marchesa at this time to make a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem; but the journey was
then so perilous and so long&mdash;none too easy,
indeed, at the present time&mdash;that she was dissuaded
from the attempt.</p>

<p>Verona, to do her honor, had a medal struck
bearing her portrait. The group of great artists&mdash;Titian,
Tintoretto, and Giorgione in Venice;
Fra Angelico, Bartolommeo, and others of that
day&mdash;were creating their wonderful works which
Vittoria must have seen and enjoyed during
this tour. Raphael, whose death had occurred
in 1520, Vittoria had, doubtless, known; but
whether it was she who was the original of the
Muse in his great picture of &ldquo;Parnassus,&rdquo; as
is alleged, is not fully established.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Unto my buried lord I give myself,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">wrote Vittoria Colonna in one of the sonnets
to her husband&rsquo;s memory, and this line is the
keynote to her entire life, both as woman and
poet. It was no translation of her life into
another key, no reckoning by stars that flashed
from different skies, when there fell upon her
the baptism and crown of that immortal friendship
with Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>The Marchesa di Pescara returned to Rome,
from this notable tour in Northern Italy, in
1538. She was received with the honors that
her fame inspired. Michael Angelo was then
deeply absorbed in painting his &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo;
in the Capella Sistina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one in Rome took an interest in the
progress of this magnificent fresco, from the
Pope (who continually visited the artist) down
to the humblest of the people. We may imagine
Vittoria standing by the great painter to
view his sublime work; but Michael Angelo
did not require the patronage, even of a Colonna,
and it is possible that Vittoria herself first
sought out his friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 270px;">

</div>

<p>In the Casa Buonarroti, in Florence, hangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that exquisite picture painted of Italy&rsquo;s greatest
woman poet, in her early youth; and in its rare
and precious collection of manuscripts are the
letters of Vittoria to the poet and sculptor. Her
influence is said to have produced a great change
in his religious views, influencing his mind to a
more lofty and more spiritual comprehension of
the divine laws that govern the universe.</p>

<p>Condivi, in referring to this chapter in their
lives, has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In particular he was most deeply attached
to the Marchesa di Pescara, of whose divine
spirit he was enamoured, and he was beloved
by her in return with much affection.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was about 1535 when Michael Angelo left
Florence for Rome, appointed by the Pope,
Paul III, as the chief architect, sculptor, and
painter of the Vatican. He was enrolled in
the Pontifical household, and he at once began
his work in the Sistine Chapel. Mr. Symonds
believes that he must have been engaged upon
the &ldquo;Last Judgment&rdquo; through 1536, 1537. The
great artist was not without a keen wit of his
own as well; for on receipt of a letter from Pietro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Aretino, from Venice, in September of 1537,
with praises of his work that Michael Angelo
deemed extravagant, he replied that while he
rejoiced in Aretino&rsquo;s commendation, he also
grieved; &ldquo;as having finished a large part of the
fresco,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot realize your conception
which is so complete that if the Day of
Judgment had come and you had been present
and seen it with your eyes, your words could
not have described it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vittoria Colonna now passed some years
between Rome and Orvieto, that picturesque
town with its magnificent cathedral rich in
medi√¶val art, where she lived in the convent of
St. Paolo d&rsquo;Orvieto. She varied this residence
by remaining at times in the convent of San
Caterina di Viterbo, in that city. In Rome she
had lived both at the convent of Santa Anna
and also at the Palazzo Cesarini, which was the
home of members of the Colonna family. A
sonnet of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s written to Vittoria
reflects the feeling that she inspired in him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Da che concetto ha l&rsquo;arte intera e diva<br /></span>
<span class="i1">La forma e gli atti d&rsquo;alcun, poi di quello<br /></span>
<span class="i1">D&rsquo;umil materia un semplice modello<br /></span>
<span class="i0">√à &rsquo;l primo parto che da quel deriva.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ma nel secondo poi di pietra viva<br /></span>
<span class="i1">S&rsquo;adempion le promesse del martello;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E s√¨ rinasce tal concetto e bello,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Che ma&rsquo; non √® chi suo eterno prescriva.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simil, di me model, nacqu&rsquo;io da prima;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Di me model, per cosa pi√π perfetta<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Da voi rinascer poi, donna alta e degna.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Se &rsquo;l poco accresce, &rsquo;l mio superchio lima<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vostra piet√†; qual penitenzia aspetta<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mio fiero ardor, se mi gastiga e insegna?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of this sonnet the following beautiful translation
is made by John Addington Symonds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When divine Art conceives a form and face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She bids the craftsman for his first essay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To shape a simple model in mere clay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the earliest birth of Art&rsquo;s embrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the live marble in the second place<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His mallet brings into the light of day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A thing so beautiful that who can say<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus my own model I was born to be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The model of that nobler self, whereto<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Schooled by your pity, lady, I shall grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each overplus and each deficiency<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You will make good. What penance then is due<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For my fierce heat, chastened and taught by you?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The correspondence between Vittoria and
Michael Angelo was undated, and all that now
remains is fragmentary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The great artist, writing to his nephew,
Sionardo, in 1554, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Messer Giovan Francisco Fattucci asked
me about a month ago if I possessed any writings
of the marchioness. I have a little book
bound in parchment which she gave me some
ten years ago. It has one hundred and three
sonnets, not counting another forty she afterward
sent on paper from Viterbo. I had these
bound into the same book, and at that time I
used to lend them about to many persons so
that they are all of them now in print. In
addition to these poems I have many letters
which she wrote from Orvieto and Viterbo.
These, then, are the writings I possess of the
marchioness.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In Rome, 1545, Michael Angelo thus writes
to Vittoria:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I desired, lady, before I accepted the things
which your ladyship has often expressed the
will to give me&mdash;I desired to produce something
for you with my own hand in order to be as
little as possible unworthy of this kindness. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
have now come to recognize that the grace of
God is not to be bought, and that to keep it
waiting is a grievous sin. Therefore I acknowledge
my error and willingly accept your
favors. When I possess them&mdash;not, indeed,
because I shall have them in my house, but for
that I myself shall dwell in them&mdash;the place will
seem to encircle me with paradise. For which
felicity I shall remain ever more obliged to your
ladyship than I am already, if that is possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bearer of this letter will be Urbino, who
lives in my service. Your ladyship may inform
him when you would like me to come and see
the head you promised to show me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>With this letter Michael Angelo sent to
Vittoria a sonnet which, in the translation
made by John Addington Symonds, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Seeking at least to be not all unfit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy sublime and boundless courtesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lowly thoughts at first were fain to try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What they could yield for grace so infinite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I know my unassisted wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all too weak to make me soar so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pardon, lady, for this fault I cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wiser still I grow remembering it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, will I see what folly &rsquo;t were to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That largess dropped from thee like dews from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could e&rsquo;er be paid by work so frail as mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To nothingness my art and talent sink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fails who from his mental stores hath given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousandfold to match one gift divine.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As a gift to Vittoria Colonna, Michael Angelo
designed an episode from the Passion of our
Lord, which Condivi describes as &ldquo;a naked
Christ at the moment when, taken from the
cross, our Lord would have fallen at the feet
of His most holy mother if two angels did not
support Him in their arms. She sits below the
cross with a face full of tears and sorrow, lifting
both her widespread arms to heaven while on
the stem of the tree above is written this legend:
&lsquo;<i>Non vi si pensa quanto sangue costa.</i>&rsquo; The
cross is of the same kind as that which was carried
by the White Friars at the time of the
plague of 1348, and afterward deposited in the
Church of Santa Croce at Florence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In presenting this cross to her he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Lady Marchioness, being myself in Rome, I
thought it hardly fitting to give the Crucified
Christ to Messer Tommaso, and to make him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
intermediary between your ladyship and me,
especially because it has been my earnest wish
to perform more for you than for any one I
ever knew upon the world. But absorbing occupations,
which still engage me, have prevented
my informing your ladyship of this. Moreover,
knowing that you know love needs no taskmaster,
and that he who loves doth not sleep,
I thought the less of using go-betweens. And
though I seemed to have forgotten, I was doing
what I did not talk about, in order to effect a
thing that was not looked for, my purpose has
been spoiled. He sins who faith like this so
soon forgets.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In reply Vittoria Colonna wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Unique Master Angelo and my most singular
friend: I have received your letter and examined
the crucifix which truly hath crucified
in my memory every other picture I ever saw.
Nowhere could one find another figure of our
Lord so well executed, so living, and so exquisitely
finished. I cannot express in words
how subtly and marvellously it is designed.
Wherefore I am resolved to take the work as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
coming from no other hand but yours.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have examined it minutely in full light and by
the lens and mirror, and never saw anything
more perfect.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>She added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your works forcibly stimulate the
judgment of all who would look at them. My
study of them made me speak of adding goodness
to things perfect in themselves, and I
have seen now that &lsquo;all is possible to him who
believes.&rsquo; I had the greatest faith in God that
He would bestow upon you supernatural grace
for the making of this Christ. When I came
to examine it I found it so marvellous that it
surpasses all my expectations. Wherefore, emboldened
by your miracles I conceived a great
desire for that which I now see marvellously
accomplished: I mean that the design is in all
parts perfect and consummate. I tell you that I
am pleased that the angel on the right hand is
by far the fairer, since Michael will place you,
with all angels, upon the right hand of the Lord
some day. Meanwhile I do not know how
else to serve you, than by making orisons to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
sweet Christ, whom you have drawn so well
and exquisitely, and praying you to hold me
yours to command as yours in all and for all.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Again Vittoria wrote to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I beg you to let me have the crucifix a short
while in my keeping, even though it be unfinished.
I want to show it to some gentlemen
who have come from the most reverend,
the Cardinal of Mantua. If you are not working
will you not come at your leisure to-day
and talk with me?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is an interesting fact to the visitor in the
Rome of to-day that the convent of San Silvestre
where Vittoria Colonna lived was attached to
the church of San Silvestre in Capite, now used
as the English-speaking Catholic church in the
Eternal City. The wing which was formerly
the convent (founded in 1318) is now converted
into the central post office.</p>

<p>It was in the sacristy of San Silvestre, decorated
with frescoes by Domenichino, that a
memorable meeting and conversation took place,
one Sunday afternoon in those far-away days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
nearly five hundred years ago, between Michael
Angelo and Francesco d&rsquo;Ollanda, a Spanish
miniature artist,&mdash;the meeting brought about
by Vittoria Colonna. The Spanish artist was
a worshipper of Michael Angelo, who &ldquo;awakened
such a feeling of love,&rdquo; that if d&rsquo;Ollanda
met him in the street &ldquo;the stars would come out
in the sky,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;before I would let him go
again.&rdquo; This fervent worship was hardly enjoyed
by its object, who avoided the Spanish
enthusiast. One Sunday, however, d&rsquo;Ollanda
had gone to San Silvestre finding there Tolomei,
to whom he was also devoted, and Vittoria
Colonna, both of whom had gone to hear the
celebrated Fra Ambrosia of Siena expound the
Epistles of St. Paul. The Marchesa di Pescara
observed that she felt sure their Spanish friend
would far rather hear Michael Angelo discuss
painting than to hear Fra Ambrosia on the
wisdom of St. Paul. Summoning an attendant
she directed him to find Michael Angelo and tell
him how cool and delightful was the church
that morning and to beg him to join Messer
Tolomei and herself; but to make no mention
of the presence of d&rsquo;Ollanda. Her woman&rsquo;s
tact and her faultless courtesy were successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
in procuring this inestimable privilege for the
Spanish painter. Michael Angelo came, and
began the conversation&mdash;which was a monologue,
rather, as all three of the friends wished
only to listen to the master&mdash;by defending
artists from the charge of eccentric and difficult
methods. With somewhat startling candor
Michael Angelo proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I dare affirm that any artist who tries to
satisfy the better vulgar rather than men of
his own craft will never become a superior
talent. For my part, I am bound to confess
that even his Holiness wearies and annoys
me by begging for too much of my company.
I am most anxious to serve him, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I
think I can do so better by studying at home
than by dancing attendance on my legs in his
reception room.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Another meeting of this little group was appointed
for the next Sunday in the Colonna
gardens behind the convent, under the shadow
of the laurel trees in the air fragrant with roses

beautiful terrace of the Colonna gardens, to
which the visitor in Rome to-day always makes
his pilgrimage, with the ruined statues and the
broken marble flights of steps, is the scene of
this meeting of Vittoria Colonna, Michael
Angelo, and Francesco d&rsquo;Ollanda. On this second
occasion the sculptor asserted his belief
that while all things are worthy the artist&rsquo;s
attention, the real test of his art is in the representation
of the human form. He extolled the
art of design. He emphasized the essential
nature of nobleness in the artist, and added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In order to represent in some degree the
adored image of our Lord, it is not enough that
a master should be great and able. I maintain
that he must also be a man of good conduct
and morals, if possible a saint, in order that the
Holy Ghost may rain down inspiration on his
understanding.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Of the relative degree of swiftness in work
Michael Angelo said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;We must regard it as a special gift from
God to be able to do that in a few hours which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
other men can only perform in many days of
labor. But should this rapidity cause a man
to fail in his best realization it would be better
to proceed slowly. No artist should allow his
eagerness to hinder him from the supreme end
of art&mdash;perfection.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Mr. Longfellow, in his unfinished dramatic
poem, &ldquo;Michael Angelo&rdquo; (to which reference

</div></div>

<p>To which Vittoria responds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&ldquo;I understand you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art is the gift of God, and must be used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto His glory. That in art is highest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which aims at this.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet, with his characteristically delicate
divination, has entered into the inner spirit of
these two immortal friends.</p>

<p>Walter Pater, writing of Michael Angelo,
truly says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Michael Angelo is always pressing forward
from the outward beauty&mdash;<i>il bel del fuor che
agli occhi piace</i>&mdash;to apprehend the unseen
beauty; <i>trascenda nella forma universale</i>&mdash;that
abstract form of beauty about which the Platonists
reason. And this gives the impression
in him of something flitting and unfixed, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
houseless and complaining spirit, almost clairvoyant
through the frail and yielding flesh.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Again we find Pater saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Though it is quite possible that Michael
Angelo had seen Vittoria, that somewhat shadowy
figure, as early as 1537, yet their closer
intimacy did not begin till about the year 1542,
when Michael Angelo was nearly seventy years
old. Vittoria herself, an ardent Neo-Catholic,
vowed to perpetual widowhood since the news
had reached her, seventeen years before, that
her husband, the youthful and princely Marquess
of Pescara, lay dead of the wounds he
had received in the battle of Pavia, was then
no longer an object of great passion. In a
dialogue written by the painter, Francesco
d&rsquo;Ollanda, we catch a glimpse of them together
in an empty church at Rome, one Sunday afternoon,
discussing indeed the characteristics of
various schools of art, but still more the writings
of St. Paul, already following the ways and
tasting the sunless pleasures of weary people,
whose hold on outward things is slackening.
In a letter still extant he regrets that when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
visited her after death he had kissed her hands
only. He made, or set to work to make, a
crucifix for her use, and two drawings, perhaps
in preparation for it, are now in Oxford.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In many ways no sentiment could have been
less like Dante&rsquo;s love for Beatrice than Michael
Angelo&rsquo;s for Vittoria Colonna. Dante&rsquo;s comes
in early youth; Beatrice is a child, with the
wistful, ambiguous vision of a child, with a
character still unaccentuated by the influence
of outward circumstances, almost expressionless.
Vittoria is a woman already weary, in
advanced age, of grave intellectual qualities.
Dante&rsquo;s story is a piece of figured work inlaid
with lovely incidents. In Michael Angelo&rsquo;s
poems frost and fire are almost the only images&mdash;the
refining fire of the goldsmith; once or twice
the ph&oelig;nix; ice melting at the fire; fire struck
from the rock which it afterwards consumes.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Visconti notes that among Italian poets,
Vittoria Colonna was the first to make religion
a subject of poetic treatment, and the first to
introduce nature&rsquo;s ministry to man into poetry.
Rota, her Italian biographer, states that she
died in February of 1547, in the Palazzo Cesarini.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
This palace is in Genzano, on Lago di
Nemi, and has been one of the Colonna estates;
but from Visconti and other authorities it is
evident that she died in Rome, either in the
convent of Santa Anna or in the palace of Cesarini,
the husband of her kinswoman, Giulio
Colonna, which must have been near the convent
in Trastevere, the old portion of Rome
across the Tiber. Visconti records that on the
last evening of her life when Michael Angelo
was beside her, she said: &ldquo;I die. Help me to
repeat my last prayer. I do not now remember
the words.&rdquo; He clasped her hand and repeated
it to her, while her own lips moved, she gazed
intently on him, smiled and passed away.
This translation has been made of Vittoria
Colonna&rsquo;s last prayer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Grant, I beseech Thee, O Lord, that I may
ever worship Thee with such humility of mind
as becometh my lowliness and such elevation of
mind as Thy loftiness demandeth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I entreat,
O Most Holy Father, that Thy most
living flame may so urge me forward that, not
being hindered by any mortal imperfections, I
may happily and safely again return to Thee.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>It is recorded by an authority that her body,
&ldquo;enclosed in a casket of cypress wood, lined
with embroidered velvet,&rdquo; was placed in the
chapel of Santa Anna which has since been
destroyed. Visconti says: &ldquo;She desired, with
Christian humility, to be buried in the manner
in which the sisters were buried when they died.
And, as I suppose, her body was placed in the
common sepulchre of the nuns of Santa Anna.&rdquo;
Grimm declares that he cannot discover the
place of her burial, and Visconti declares that
her tomb remains unknown.</p>

<p>But it is apparently a fact that the body of
Vittoria Colonna is entombed in the sacristy
of Santa Domenica Maggiore in Naples, the
sarcophagus containing it resting by the side
of the one containing the body of her husband,
Francesco d&rsquo;Avalos, Marchese of Pescara. This
church is one of the finest in Naples, with
twenty-seven chapels and twelve altars, and it
is here that nearly all the great nobles of the
kingdom of Naples are entombed. Here is the
tomb of the learned Thomas Aquinas and here
is shown, in relief, the miracle of the crucifix
by Tommaso de Stefani, which&mdash;as the legend
runs&mdash;thus addressed the learned doctor:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bene scripsisti de me, Thoma; quam ergo
mercedem <a name="tn332" id="tn332"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'recipris'">recipies</ins>?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which he replied: &ldquo;<i>Non aliam nisi
te.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is in the sacristy in which lie all the Princes
of the House of Aragon that the sarcophagi
of the Marchese and the Marchesa di Pescara
are placed side by side in the high gallery
near the ceiling. The altar has a fine Annunciation
ascribed to Andrea da Salerno. The
ceiling (whose coloring is as fresh and vivid
as if painted yesterday) is by Solimena. Around
the walls near the ceiling are two balconies
or galleries, filled with very large wooden
sarcophagi, whose scarlet velvet covers have
faded into yellow browns with pink shades,
many of which are tattered and are falling to
pieces. The casket containing the body of Fernando
Francesco d&rsquo;Avalos, Marchese of Pescara
(the husband of Vittoria Colonna), has on
it an inscription by Ariosto; and his portrait
(showing in profile a young face with blonde
hair and a full reddish brown beard) and a
banner, also, is suspended above the casket.
That containing the body of the Marchesa,
his wife (Vittoria Colonna), has an aperture at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the top where the wood is worn away and the
embalmed form, partly crumbled, may be seen.
This seems strange to the verge of fantasy, but
it is, apparently, true. The writer of this
volume visited the Church of Santa Domenica
Maggiore in Naples in December of 1906, and
was assured by the sacristan that this sarcophagus
contains the body of the Marchesa. Inquiries
were then made of other prelates and of
the Archbishop, who gave the same assurance.
Later, learned arch√¶ologists in Rome were
appealed to, regarding this assertion made in
Naples, and the consensus of opinion obtained
declares their assertion true. Professor Lanciani
has himself publicly expressed this conviction.
Still, it remains a curious question as
to when this sarcophagus was placed in the
sacristy, for the date goes back into long-buried
centuries.</p>

<p>Adjoining Santa Domenica Maggiore is the
monastery in which Thomas Aquinas lived and
lectured (in 1272), and the cell of the great
doctor of philosophy is now made into a chapel.
His lectures called together men of the highest
rank and learning and were attended by the
king and the members of the royal family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
The entire locality of this church is replete with
historic association. The most distinguished of
the nobility of Naples have, for centuries, held
their chapels in this church, and in these are
many notable examples of Renaissance sculpture.</p>

<p>The Accad√©mia des Arcades of Rome,
founded in the seventeenth century to do honor
to lyric art, celebrated the placing of a bust of
Vittoria Colonna in a gallery of the Capitoline,
in May of 1865, by a resplendent poetic festa.
According to the gentle, leisurely customs of the
land, where it is always afternoon and time has
no value, thirty-two poets read their songs,
written in Latin or in Italian, for this occasion,
which were published in a sumptuous volume
to be preserved in the archives of the Arcadians,
who take themselves more seriously than the
world outside quite realizes. This bust of Vittoria
Colonna was the gift of the Duca and
Duchessa of Torlonia of that period. It was
crowned with laurel, as that of Petrarca had
been, and the government took official recognition
of the event.</p>

<p>Goethe was made a member of this Accad√©mia
that regarded itself as reflecting the glories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the Golden Age of Greece, and which was a
century old at the time of his visit to Italy.
&ldquo;No stranger of any consequence was readily
permitted to leave Rome without being invited
to join this body,&rdquo; he recorded, and he wrote
a humorous description of the formalities of
his initiation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Horatio Greenough was honored by
being made a member of this Accad√©mia in
recognition of her musical accomplishments,
and the record of it is placed on the memorial
marble over her grave in the Protestant cemetery
in Rome. Every year, on Tasso&rsquo;s birthday
(April 25), the Accad√©mia holds a festa in a
little amphitheatre near &ldquo;Tasso&rsquo;s oak,&rdquo; on the
Janiculum, at which his bust is crowned with
laurel. The gardens in which the seventeenth-century
Arcadians disported themselves are now
known among the Romans as <i>il Bosco Parrasio
degli Arcadi</i>.</p>

<p>Throughout Italy the fame of Vittoria Colonna
only deepens with every succeeding century.
Her nobility of character, her lofty spirituality
of life, fitly crowned and perfected her intellectual
force and brilliant gifts. Although from
the customs of the time the Marchesa lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
much in convents, she never, in any sense, save
that of her fervent piety, lived the conventual
life. Her noble gifts linked her always to the
larger activities, and her gifts and rank invested
her with certain demands and responsibilities
that she could not evade. She was one of
the messengers of life, and her place as a
brilliant and distinguished figure in the contemporary
world was one that the line of
destiny, which pervades all circumstances and
which, in her case, was so marked, absolutely
constrained her to fill. She had that
supreme gift of the lofty nature, the power of
personal influence. Her exquisite courtesy and
graciousness of manner, her simple dignity and
unaffected sincerity, her delicacy of divination
and her power of tender sympathy and liberal
comprehension all combined to make her the
ideal companion, counsellor, and friend, as well
as the celebrity of letters and lyric art.</p>

<p>No poet has more exquisitely touched the
friendship between Vittoria Colonna and Michael
Angelo than has Margaret J. Preston,
in a poem supposed to be addressed to the
sculptor by Vittoria, in which occur the
lines:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">To catch the echo of that voice of love.<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Celia Richmond.</span><br />
</p></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> mystic pilgrimage to Assisi, the &ldquo;Seraphic
City,&rdquo; prefigures itself almost as a journey to
the Mount of Vision. &ldquo;Any line of truth that
leads us above materialism,&rdquo; says Dr. Wilberforce,
Venerable Archdeacon of Westminster
Abbey, &ldquo;that forces us to think, that encourages
the imagination to pierce the world&rsquo;s
cobwebs, that forces us to remember that
we are enwrapped by the supernatural, is
helpful and stimulating. A human life lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
only in the seen and felt, with no sense of the
invisible, is a fatally impoverished life, a poor,
blind, wingless life, but to believe that ever
around us is a whole world full of spiritual
beings; that this life, with its burdens, is but
the shadow which precedes the reality; that
here we are but God&rsquo;s children at school, is
an invigorating conviction, full of hope, productive
of patience and fruitful in self-control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To an age imprisoned in the fear of God
the &ldquo;sweet saint,&rdquo; Francis, brought the message
of the love of God. To an age crushed under
the abuses of religion as an organization of
feudal bishops and ecclesiastics, St. Francis
brought the message of hope and of joy. He
revealed to his age the absolute reality of the
spiritual world that surrounds us. He was
born into a time when there existed on the
one hand, poverty and misery; on the other,
selfish and debasing self-indulgence of wealth
and its corresponding oppression of the poor.
The Church itself was a power for conquest
and greed. Its kingdom was of this world.
St. Bernard and others had nobly aimed to
effect a reform and had illustrated by their own
lives the beautiful example of simplicity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
unselfishness, but their work failed in effectiveness
and permanent impress.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, beauty of holiness!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of self-forgetfulness, of lowliness.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not only in beauty, but in power does it
stand. St. Francis brought to the sad and
problematic conditions of his time that resistless
energy of infinite patience, of a self-control
based on insight into the divine relationships
of life, and of unfailing fidelity to his high purpose.
Through good report or through evil
report he kept the faith, and pressed onward
to the high calling of God. The twelfth and the
thirteenth centuries had been a period of religious
unrest and chaos. As Archdeacon Wilberforce
has so impressively said in the words
quoted from him, a life lived with no sense of
the invisible is blind and impoverished. The
movement initiated by St. Francis proclaimed
anew the divine grace and love.</p>

<p>Something not unlike this trend of thought
must drift through the mind of every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
who journeys through the lovely Umbrian
country to Assisi, one of those picturesquely
beautiful hill towns of Italy whose romantic
situation impresses the visitor. Seen from a
little distance, one could hardly imagine how
it could be reached unless he were the fortunate
possessor of an airship. The entire region
is most picturesque in character. Journeying
from Rome to Assisi there is a constant ascent
from the Campagna to the Apennines,
and the road passes through wild defile and
valley with amethyst peaks shining fair against
the sky, with precipitous rocks, and the dense
growth of oak and pine trees. In some places
the valley is so narrow that the hills, on either
side, rise almost within touch of the hand from
the car window. The hill towns are frequent,
and the apex of these towns is invariably
crowned with a castle, a cathedral, or a ruin,
and around it, circling in terraces, is built the
town. The charm largely vanishes when fairly
in these circling roads, for on either side are
high walls, so that one&rsquo;s view is completely
bounded by them; but from the summit and
from the upper floors of the houses the most
beautiful views are obtained. The Umbrian region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
in which are located Perugia, Assisi, Spello,
Foligno, Spoleto, Terni, Narni, and others, is
simply the gem region of all Italy. The Umbrians
are the most ancient of the Italian people,
and Assisi claims to have been founded eight
hundred and sixty-five years before the founding
of Rome. It was the scene of constant
warfare, and the streets are all underlaid by
subterranean passages, in which the inhabitants
could disappear from their enemies.</p>

<p>To this ancient Umbrian city, from which
went out the life and light that carried wonderful
currents of vitality and illumination to all
Italy and into almost all parts of the world, one
comes as to a special and a sacred pilgrimage.
For this medi√¶val town, perched on the top of
a rocky hill, is the birthplace of St. Francis,
the founder of the Franciscan order; in it were
the scenes of his early life, and here, in 1226,
at the age of forty-four years, he died. The
convent-church of San Francesco, built to his
memory in 1230; the lower church, completed at
that date, while the upper was finished in 1253;
the magnificent Cathedral of Santa Maria Degli
Angeli, completed in 1640; the Church of Santa
Chiara and the Duomo, are the points of interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/assisib.jpg"><img src="images/assisi.jpg" width="400" height="301" alt="SAN FRANCESCAN CONVENT-CHURCH, ASSISI" title="SAN FRANCESCAN CONVENT-CHURCH, ASSISI" /></a>
<p class="caption noi"><small>SAN FRANCESCAN CONVENT-CHURCH, ASSISI</small></p>
</div>

<p>The purple Apennines, on one spur of which
Assisi is built, are a picturesque feature of lovely
Umbria. The old houses of Assisi rise white
in the sunshine. The ancient walls still surround
the city, and its towers stand as they
stood before the eyes of St. Francis, almost seven
centuries ago. The peak of Mt. Subasio, a
neighboring peak of the Apennines, looms above
the colossal rock that crowns the hill around
whose top Assisi clusters in winding terraces.
The massive pile of the Francescan church and
monastery&mdash;the two churches, one above the
other&mdash;forms an architectural group whose imposing
aspect arrests the eye of every traveller
for miles around. The pointed arches of the
cloisters and the square campanile contrast
rather than blend in an effective and harmonious
manner and resemble military fortifications
rather than an edifice of the church. The old
walls still surround Assisi, and the houses all
rise white under the blue Italian sky. The
narrow streets, hardly wide enough for one carriage
to pass another, are so intricate in their
curves as they climb the steep hill, that it requires
a faith hardly less than the traditional
degree said to move mountains to lead the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
visitor to suppose that he will ever emerge from
one that he has entered. Many of the houses
along these curious thoroughfares have no windows,
the only light and air coming through the
open door. The bells from the campanile
of the Francescan convent-church, from the
Duomo and from the Church of Santa Chiara
ring every quarter of an hour; and this constant
clash of bells is almost the only sound that
breaks the silence of the medi√¶val town, which
lends itself to visions and to dreams. On the
very air is stamped the impress of St. Francis.
His personality, his teachings, his faith pervaded
the atmosphere in a way that no one
could believe until he had himself entered into
the experience. In narration it cannot but
seem like a pleasing and half-poetic fancy;
but the lingerer in this shrine of religion
and art will realize that the actual personality
of the man who trod these streets nearly
seven hundred years ago is strangely before
him. Canon Knox Little, in a series of lectures
on St. Francis of Assisi delivered in
the Ladye Chapel of Worcester Cathedral a
few years since, says of the panorama of the
town:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The scene which from Assisi presented itself
daily to his youthful eyes must have had, did
have, as we know, a lasting effect upon his mind.
From thence the eye surveys a noble coronet of
stately mountains. You look from Radicofani,
above Trena, to Monte Catria, famous as the
scene of some of Dante&rsquo;s saddest times of solitude,
and ever is the eye satisfied with the grace
and grandeur of the curves of mountain outline,
and the changing hues of an incomparable sky.
There are rivers and cities and lakes,&mdash;from
Thrasymene, just hidden by a line of crests, to
the Paglia and Tiber beneath, where Orvieto
crowns its severe and lonely rock. With the
changing lights and shadows always beautiful in
the vivid spring or burning summer, tender-tinted
autumn or clear and sparkling winter, with the
bright and pure and buoyant atmosphere always
giving life and vigor, what spot on earth more
fitted as the birthplace of the saint who was,
above all things, bright and tender and strong?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Assisi was an important town in the twelfth
century when Francis, the son of Pietro Bernardone
di Mercanti, wandered over its hills, and
after severe fasting and prayer communed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
God. Born in the midst of the constant warfare
between Assisi and Perugia, he was first a
soldier. He was captured and thrown into
prison, and it was a remarkable dream, or vision,
that came to him before he was set free, that
determined his life of consecration. Tradition
invested his birth with legends, one of which is,
that in his infancy an aged man came to the
door and begged to be permitted to take the
child in his arms, prophesying that he was
destined to accomplish a great work. Pietro
Bernardone was a wealthy merchant of Assisi.
Pica, the mother of Francis, is said to have been
of noble origin and of a deeply religious nature.
The early youth of Francis was given to games,
festivals, and pleasures that degenerated into
dissipation, but the mother continually affirmed
her assurance that, if it pleased God, her
son would become a Christian. In this atmosphere
was nurtured &ldquo;the sweet-souled saint
of medi√¶val Italy,&rdquo; who is described as a figure
of magical power, whose ardent temperament
and mystic loveliness attracted to him
all men.</p>

<p>There is also a legend that Pica went to pray
at the Portiuncula and that, for seven years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
she prayed for a son. Her prayer was answered
in the coming of the infant who was to be the
great saint of all the ages. Francis, in his childhood,
also knelt and prayed at this shrine. In
the year 1211, when Francis was twenty-nine
years of age and had entered on his ministry,
this chapel was given to him, &ldquo;and no sooner
had they come to live here,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;than
the Lord multiplied their number from day to
day.&rdquo; At one time he had gone to his devotions
in great depression of spirits, &ldquo;when, suddenly,
an unspeakable ecstasy filled his breast. &lsquo;Be
comforted, my dearest,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and rejoice
in the Lord, and let us not be sad that we are
few; for it has been shown to me by God that
you shall increase to a great multitude and shall
go on increasing to the end of the world. I see
a multitude of men coming to me from every
quarter&mdash;French, Spaniards, Germans, English&mdash;each
in their different tongues encouraging
the others.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a distance of perhaps a mile and a half
from Assisi, down in the valley near the railroad
station, four holy pilgrims founded a shrine in
the fourth century. Later, on this site, St.
Benedict erected a tiny chapel, called &ldquo;St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Maria della Portiuncula&rdquo; (St. Mary of the
Little Patron), and once, when praying in the
chapel, Benedict had a vision of a vast crowd of
people kneeling in ecstasy, chanting hymns of
praise, while outside greater multitudes waited
to kneel before the shrine, and he took this to
mean that a great saint would one day be honored
there.</p>

<p>So the legends, still conversationally told in
Assisi, run on and are locally current. Undoubtedly
the dwellers in this curious old town,
whose streets have hardly one level spot but
climb up and down the steep hillside, realize
that their saint is their title to fame and their
revenue as well; yet through all the tales there
breathes a certain sincerity and simplicity of
worship. The little dark primitive shops teem
with relics, which make, it is true, a great
draft on imagination, and by what miracle
modern photography has contrived to present
the saint of Assisi in various impressive attitudes
and groups it would be as well not to inquire
too closely. It is a part of the philosophy of
travel to take the goods the gods provide, and
the blending of amused tolerance and unsuspected
depths of reverential devotion by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the visitor will find himself moved, while in
Assisi, can hardly be described. For, surely,
here</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whitest of the saints of God,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">and Catholic or Protestant, one equally enters
into the beauty of his memory. The double
and triple arches of the convent church enclose
cloistered walls continually filled with visitors.
No shrine in Italy holds such mysterious power.
Simplicity and joy were the two keynotes of
the life taught by St. Francis. &ldquo;Poverty,&rdquo; he
asserted, &ldquo;is the happy state of life in which
men are set free from the trammels of conventionalism,
and can breathe the pure air of God&rsquo;s
love. The richest inward life is enjoyed when
life is poorest outwardly. Be poor,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;try a new principle; be careless of
having and getting; try <i>being</i>, for a change.
Our life in the world ought to be such that any
one on meeting us should be constrained to
praise the heavenly Father. Be not an occasion
of wrath to any one,&rdquo; he often said, &ldquo;but
by your gentleness may all be led to press onward
to good works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The supreme aim of Francis was that of
service to humanity. He gave himself with
impassioned fervor to this one work. For him
there were no ideals of cloistered seclusion or
of devotion to learning and art, but the ideal
alone to uplift humanity. It was literally and
simply, indeed, the Christ ideal. Of the &ldquo;Rule&rdquo;
made, one of his biographers says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Amid all these encouragements the Rule
was made. It consists, like other monastic
rules, of the three great vows of poverty, chastity,
and obedience, differing only in so far that
the poverty ordained by Francis was absolute.
In other rules, though the individual was allowed
to possess nothing, the community had often
rich possessions, and there was no reason why
the monks should not fare sumptuously and
secure to themselves many earthly enjoyments,
notwithstanding their individual destitution and
their vow. But among the Brothers Minor
there was not to be so much as a provision secured
for the merest daily necessities. Day by
day they were to live by God&rsquo;s providence, eating
what was given to them, taking no thought
how they were to be fed, or wherewithal clothed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
&lsquo;neither gold nor silver in your purses;&rsquo; not
even the scrip to collect fragments in&mdash;as if
God could not provide for every returning necessity.
There had been monasteries in Italy for
centuries, and the Benedictines were already a
great and flourishing community; but this absolute
renunciation of all things struck a certain
chill to the hearts of all who heard of it, except
the devoted band who had no will but that of
Francis. His friend, the Bishop of Assisi, was one
of those who stumbled at this novel and wonderful
self-devotion. &lsquo;Your life, without a possession
in the world, seems to me most hard and
terrible,&rsquo; said the compassionate prelate. &lsquo;My
lord,&rsquo; said Francis, &lsquo;if we had possessions, arms
and protection would be necessary to us.&rsquo; There
was a force in this response which perhaps we
can scarcely realize, but the Assisan bishop, who
knew something of the temper of the lords of
Umbria, and knew how lonely were the brethren
dwelling on the church lands&mdash;the little plot
(Portiuncula) a whole half league from the city
gates&mdash;understood and perceived the justice of
the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another grand distinction of the Rule drawn
up by Francis was the occupation it prescribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
to its members. They were not to shut themselves
up, or to care first for their own salvation.
They were to preach&mdash;this was their
special work; they were to proclaim repentance
and the remission of sins; they were to be
heralds of God to the world, and proclaim the
coming of His kingdom. It is not possible to
suppose that when he thus began to organize
the mind of Francis did not make a survey of
the establishments already in existence&mdash;the
convents bound by the same three great vows,
where life at this moment was going on so
placidly, with flocks and herds and vineyards to
supply the communities, and studious monks
in their retirement, safe from all secular anxieties,
fostering all the arts in their beginning, and
carrying on the traditions of learning; while all
around them the great unquiet, violent world
heaved and struggled, yet within the convent
walls there was leisure and peace. Blessed
peace and leisure it was often, let us allow,
preserving for us the germs of many good things
we now enjoy, and raising little centres of safety
and charity and brotherly kindness through the
country in which they were placed. But such
quiet was not in the nature of Francis. So far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
as we can make out, he had thought little of
himself&mdash;even of his own soul to be saved&mdash;all
his life. The trouble on his mind had been
what to do, how sufficiently to work for God
and to help men. His fellow creatures were
dear to him; he gave them his cloak from his
shoulders many a day, and the morsel from
his own lips, and would have given them the
heart from his bosom had that been possible.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>These are the &ldquo;voices&rdquo; that still echo in the air
of Assisi. In the suburbs is still shown the spot
where the chapel of St. Damian stood up a rocky
path on the hillside in an olive grove. It was
here that the scene of the miracle of the crucifix
is laid. Before the altar Francis knelt, praying:
&ldquo;Great and Glorious Father, and thou, Lord
Jesus, I pray ye, shed abroad your light in the
darkness of my mind. May I in all things act
in accordance with thy holy will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is recorded that while he thus knelt in deep
prayer, he was unable to turn his eyes from the
cross, conscious that something marvellous was
taking place. The image of the Saviour assumed
life; the eyes turned attentively on him;
a voice spoke accepting his service and he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
at once endowed with the most marvellous tide
of vitality, of joy, and of exhilaration. At this
moment he entered on that life whose impress
is left on the ages. Of the character and the
peculiar quality of its influence Mrs. Oliphant
well says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It is not always possible to follow with our
sympathy that literal, childlike rendering of
every incident in the life of the Master, which
sometimes looks fantastical and often unmeaning.
He was a man of his time, and could live
only under the conditions which that time
allowed. He made visible to a literal, practical,
unquestioning age the undeniable and astounding
fact that the highest of all beings chose a
life of poverty, hardship, and humbleness; that
He chose submission instead of resistance, love
instead of oppression, peace and forgiveness instead
of revenge and war. Christ had died in
their hearts, as said the legend of that Christmas
at Greccia; and, as in one of the bold and artless
pictures just then beginning to yield to a
more refined and subtle art, Francis set forth
before the world the image of his Master. The
Son of man was lifted up, as on another cross,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
before the eyes of Umbria, before all Italy,
warlike and wily, priest and baron, peasant and
Pope. In this world Francis knew nothing,
acknowledged nothing, cared for nothing save
Christ and Him crucified&mdash;except, indeed,
Christ&rsquo;s world, the universe redeemed, the souls
to be saved, the poor to be comforted, the friends
to be cherished, the singing birds and bubbling
fountains, the fair earth and the sweet sky.
Courteous, tender, and gentle as any paladin,
sweet-tongued and harmonious as any poet,
liberal as any prince, was the barefooted beggar
and herald of God. We ask no visionary reverence
for the Stigmata, no wondering belief in
any miracle. As he stood, he was as great a
miracle as any then existing under God&rsquo;s abundant,
miraculous heavens; more wonderful than
are the day and night, the sun and the dew;
only less wonderful than that great Love which
saves the world, and which it was his aim and
destiny to reflect and show forth.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>That mystic union to which all the ages
attest, the union that may, at any moment, be
formed between the soul and God, that mystery
which the church calls conversion and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
finds its perfect interpretation in the words of
St. Paul, when he said, that if any man be in
Christ he is a new creation, had been accomplished
in the life of Francis. He realized the
fulness of the knowledge of God&rsquo;s will; he longed
only for wisdom and for spiritual understanding.
Nor is this experience one to be relegated to the
realm of miracle. It is simply entering into
the supreme completeness of life. It is not
alone St. Paul, but every man, who may truly
say, &ldquo;I can do all things through Christ, who
strengtheneth me.&rdquo; Nor does this experience,
when translated aright into daily life and action,
require any abnormal form of expression. It
does not, in its truest significance, mean a life
apart from the ordinary duties, but rather
it means that these duties shall be fulfilled in
the larger and nobler way. The exceptional
man may be called to be the standard bearer;
to renounce all domestic ties and give his service
to the world; but such a life as this differs
only in degree from that which in the ordinary
home and social relations finds ample means
for its best expression. The persistent aim
after perfection should be the keynote of every
life. No one should be satisfied to hold as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
supreme ideal any lesser standard of ultimate
achievement than is involved in the divine command,
&ldquo;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father in heaven is perfect.&rdquo; This is the
soul&rsquo;s ideal, whatever ages and eternities it may
require for it to recognize this trackless path.</p>

<p>St. Francis recognized joy as a factor of the
nobler life. &ldquo;It was his constant effort,&rdquo; writes
one biographer, &ldquo;that there should be bright
looks and cheerful tones about him. To one
of his brethren, who had the habit of walking
about sadly with his head drooping, he said,&mdash;it
is evident, with a spark of the impatience
natural to his own vivacious spirit,&mdash;&lsquo;You
may surely repent of your sins, my brother,
without showing your grief so openly. Let
your sorrow be between God and you: pray to
Him to pardon you by His mercy, and to restore
to your soul the joy of His salvation. But before
me and the others be always cheerful, for it
does not become a servant of God to have an
air of melancholy and a face full of trouble.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>An incident in the early life of St. Francis,
which had determining significance, was his
meeting with Dominic. The story is told &ldquo;that
Dominic, praying in a church in Rome, saw, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
a vision, our Lord rise from the right hand of
the Father in wrath, wearied at last with the
contradiction of sinners, with a terrible aspect
and three lances in his hand, each one of which
was to destroy from the face of the earth a distinct
class of offenders. But while the dreamer
gazed at this awful spectacle, the Virgin Mother
arose and pleaded for the world, declaring that
she had two faithful servants whom she was
about to send into it to bring sinners to the
feet of the Saviour; one of these was Dominic
himself, the other was a poor man, meanly
clad, whom he had never seen before. This
vision came to the devout Spaniard, according
to the legend, during the night, which he spent,
as he was wont, in a church, in prayer. Next
morning, while he mused on the dream which
had been sent to him, his eye fell all at once
upon a stranger in a brown tunic, of aspect as
humble and modest as his garb, coming into
the same church to pray. Dominic at once ran
to him, fell on his neck, and, saluting him with
a kiss, cried, &lsquo;Thou art my companion: thy work
and mine is the same. If we stand by each
other, nothing can prevail against us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>No magic mirror, however, revealed to Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the wonderful panorama of his future. No
sibyl turned the leaves of the records yet to
unfold. &ldquo;He was preparing himself for a life
of penitence rather than a life of activity,&rdquo; in
the opinion of Paul Sabatier, and he had
dreamed no dream of becoming a religious
founder. He was so entirely without any personal
ambition, save that of being obedient to
the Heavenly Vision, that this absolute consecration
of purpose enabled the divine power
to work through him without obstruction. He
became a very perfect instrument, so to speak,
in the divine hand. After repairing the little
chapel called the Portiuncula, on the level
ground at the foot of the hill, some two miles
from Assisi, his plan was to there pass his time
in meditation and prayer. But the legend runs
that on the feast of St. Mathias (February 24), in
the winter of 1209, a Benedictine monk was
celebrating mass and on his turning to read,
&ldquo;Wherever ye go preach, saying, The kingdom
of heaven is at hand,&rdquo; Francis was profoundly
and peculiarly impressed, and he exclaimed:
&ldquo;This is what I desire, O Father; from this
day forth I set myself to put this command in
practice.&rdquo; He felt that Jesus himself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
spoken to him through the priest. Love and
sacrifice became to him the supreme ideals,
and in this moment, in that poor and bare little
chapel, was inaugurated one of the greatest
and most far-reaching religious movements of
the entire world.</p>

</div></div>

<p>That great ministry of St. Francis, whose
influence pervades all time,&mdash;that lies between
the opening years of the thirteenth and the
opening years of the twentieth centuries,&mdash;was
initiated the next morning in Assisi, when Francis
preached for the first time. He spoke simply,
emphasizing the truths he had learned to realize
through his own experience: the absolute duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
of following after perfection; the importance of
realizing the shortness of life and the need of
repentance. The first disciple of Francis was
a wealthy resident of Assisi, named Bernardo.
He was impressed with the conviction that he
should distribute his possessions and unite with
Francis in all his aims and work. Without
definite organization, others joined them. They
passed that spring and summer going up and
down the country, sometimes assisting the harvesters
and haymakers, and everywhere entering
into the common life of the people. The
Bishop of Assisi, however, remonstrated with
Francis, saying that to him it seemed very harsh
and unwise to try to live without owning anything.
To which Francis replied that he did
not desire temporal possessions, as these required
arms for their defence and were an
obstacle to the love of God and one&rsquo;s neighbor.
It has remained for later years to discern the
still truer significance of the teachings of Jesus,
that neither possessions nor the lack of possessions
form the real test, but the use which is
made of them. As spiritual insight is developed
it is more and more clearly realized that the
quality of the life lived is the sole matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
importance, and not the conditions that surround
it.</p>

<p>The brotherhood increased. The abbot of
the Benedictines on Monte Subasio ceded to
Francis and his order the little chapel called
the Portiuncula, now enclosed within the vast
and magnificent church of Santa Maria degli
Angeli. M. Paul Sabatier, in his admirable
biography of St. Francis, points out clearly that
the founder of the Franciscans contemplated a
laboring and not a mendicant order. During
the decade 1211 to 1221, which Francis and his
followers passed at the Portiuncula, a portion of
the time was constantly passed in industrial pursuits.
&ldquo;With all his gentleness, Francis knew
how to show an inflexible severity toward the
idle,&rdquo; says Sabatier, &ldquo;and he even went so far
as to dismiss a friar who refused to work.&rdquo;
Although Francis espoused poverty, declaring
that she was his bride, he was unfalteringly loyal

<p>The mystic legends of the life of their saint
that abound in Assisi are touched with poetic romance
in that a companion figure is always seen
by his side, that of Santa Chiara. Not more
inseparable in popular thought are Dante and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Beatrice, or Petrarca and Laura, than are Francis
and Clara. Their statues stand side by side
in the Duomo; they are represented together
by both painter and sculptor in the churches
of Santa Chiara and Santa Maria degli Angeli
in the old hill town. Chiara was the daughter
of a noble family, and as a girl of sixteen, coming
under the influence of Francis from hearing
one of his sermons, she, too, became one of
his followers and left her father&rsquo;s palace in
Assisi to take the vows of perpetual and voluntary
poverty at the altar of the Portiuncula.
Followed by two women, she passed swiftly
through the town in the dead of the night, and
through dark woods, her hurrying figure seeming
like some spirit driven by winds towards an
unknown future. One thing alone was clear
before her&mdash;that she was nearing the abode of
Francis Bernardone whose preaching at San
Giorgio only a month before had thrilled her,
inspiring her in this strange way to seek the life
he had described in fiery words. Just as she
came in sight of the Portiuncula the chanting
of the brethren, which had reached her in the
wood, suddenly ceased, and they came out with
lighted torches in expectation of her coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Swiftly and without a word she passed in to
attend the midnight mass which Francis was to
serve, and the scene is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The ceremony was simple, wherein lies the
charm of all things Franciscan. The service
over and the last blessing given, St. Francis led
Clare toward the altar, and with his own hands
cut off her long, fair hair and unclasped the
jewels from her neck. But a few minutes more
and a daughter of the proud house of Scifi
stood clothed in the brown habit of the
order, the black veil of religion falling about
her shoulders, lovelier far in this nun-like
severity than she had been when decked out
in all her former luxury of silken gowns and
precious gems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was arranged that Clare was to go afterward
to the Benedictine nuns of San Paolo,
near Bastia, about an hour&rsquo;s walk farther on
in the plain. So when the final vows had been
taken, St. Francis took her by the hand and
they passed out of the chapel together just as
dawn was breaking, while the brethren returned
to their cells gazing half sadly, as they
passed, at the coils of golden hair and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
little heap of jewels which still lay upon the
altar cloth.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Clara founded a convent and lived as its
abbess, and the great church of Santa Chiara
is built on the site of this convent. She was
born in Assisi in 1194, and died in 1253, surviving
Francis by twenty-seven years. Her
father was the Count Favorini Scifi, and he had
destined his daughter&mdash;who had great beauty&mdash;to
a rich and brilliant marriage. He violently
opposed her choice of the religious life, but no
earthly power, she declared, should sever her
from it.</p>

<p>The beauty of the lifelong friendship between
Francis and Clara is thus touched upon by
Mrs. Oliphant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It was one of those tender and touching
friendships which are to the student of history
like green spots in the desert; and which
gave to the man and the woman thus voluntarily
separated from all the joys of life a certain
human consolation in the midst of their hardships.
They can have seen each other but
seldom, for it was one of the express stipulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of the Franciscan Rule that the friars should
refrain from all society with women, and have
only the most sparing and reserved intercourse
even with their sisters in religion. And Francis
was no priest, nor had he the privilege of hearing
confession and directing the spiritual life of
his daughter in the faith. But he sent to her to
ask enlightenment from her prayers, when any
difficulty was in his way. He went to see her
when he was in trouble; especially once on his
way to Rieti to have an operation performed
on his eyes. Once the two friends ate together
at a sacramental meal, the pledge and almost
the conclusion on earth of that tenderest, most
disinterested, and unworldly love which existed
between them. That he was sure of her sympathy
in all things, of her prayers and spiritual
aid, whatsoever he might be doing, wheresoever
he might be, no doubt was sweet to Francis
in all his labors and trials. As he walked many
a weary day past that church of St. Damian,
every stone of which was familiar to him, and
many laid with his own hands, must not his
heart have warmed at thought of the sister
within, safe from all conflict with the world,
upon whose fellow-feeling he could rely absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
as man can rely only on woman? The
world has jeered at the possibility of such friendships
from its earliest age; and yet they have
always existed,&mdash;one of the most exquisite and
delicate of earthly ties. Gazing back into that
far distance over the graves, not only of those
two friends, but of a hundred succeeding generations,
a tear of grateful sympathy comes into
the student&rsquo;s eye. He is glad to believe that,
all those years, Francis could see in his comings
and goings the cloister of Clara; and that this
sacred gleam of human fellowship,&mdash;love purified
of all self-seeking,&mdash;tender, visionary, celestial
affection, sweetened their solitary lives.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Legends innumerable, attesting supernormal
manifestations regarding Francis, sprang up and
have been perpetuated through the ages. One
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Hardly more than three years from the
moment when the pale penitent was hooted
through Assisi amid the derisive shouts of the
people, and driven with blows and curses into
confinement in his own father&rsquo;s house, we find
that it has already become his custom on Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to preach in the cathedral; and that, from
his little convent at the Portiuncula, Francis
has risen into influence in the whole country,
which no doubt by this time was full of stories
of his visit to Rome and intercourse with the
Pope, and all the miraculous dreams and
parables with which that intercourse was attended.
Already the mind of the people, so
slow to adopt, but so ready to become habituated
to, anything novel, had used itself to the
sight of the brethren in their brown gowns, and,
leaping from one extreme to the other, instead
of madmen, learned to consider them saints.
The air about the little cloister began to breathe
of miracles,&mdash;miracles which must have been
a matter of common report among the contemporaries
of the saint, for Celano wrote
within three years of Francis&rsquo;s death. Once,
when their leader was absent, a sudden wonder
startled the brethren. It was midnight between
Saturday and Sunday, and Francis, who had
gone to preach at Assisi, was at the moment
praying in the canon&rsquo;s garden. A chariot of
fire, all radiant and shining, suddenly entered
the house, awaking those who lay asleep, and
moving to wonder and awe those who watched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
or labored, or prayed. It was the heart and
thoughts of their leader returning to them in
the midst of his prayer, which were figured by
this appearance.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>When Francis died a pathetic scene is thus
described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;All the clergy of Assisi, chanting solemn
hymns, came out to meet the bier, and thus
they climbed the hill to the birthplace of the
saint, the city of his toils and tears and blessing.
When they came to St. Damian an affecting
pause was made. Clara within, with all her
maidens, waited the last visit of their father and
friend. Slowly the triumphant crowd defiled
into the church of the nuns, hushing, let us
hope, their songs of joy, their transports of
gratulations, out of respect to the grief which
dwelt there, and could scarcely, by all the arguments
of family pride, or the excitement of this
universal triumph, be brought to rejoice. The
bier was set down within the chancel, the coffin
opened, and opened also was the little window
through which the nuns received the sacrament
on ordinary occasions. To this little opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the pale group of nuns, ten of them, with Clara
at their head, came marching silently, with
tears and suppressed cries. Clara herself, even
in face of that multitude, could not restrain her
grief. &lsquo;Father, father, what will become of us?&rsquo;
she cried out; &lsquo;who will care for us now, or
console us in our troubles?&rsquo; &lsquo;Virgin modesty,&rsquo;
says Celano, stopped her lamentations, and with
a miserable attempt at thanksgiving, reminding
herself that the angels were rejoicing at his
coming, and all was gladness on his arrival in
the city of God, the woman who had been his
closest friend in this world, whose sympathy
he had sought so often, kissed the pale hands&mdash;&lsquo;splendid
hands,&rsquo; says Celano, in his enthusiasm,
&lsquo;adorned with precious gems and shining
pearls&rsquo;&mdash;and disappeared from the little window
with her tears into the dim convent behind,
where nobody could reprove her sorrow.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The personality of Chiara comes down to us
through the ages invested with untold charm.
It is said that when she was dying there came
&ldquo;a long procession of white-robed virgins, led
by the Queen of Heaven, whose head was
crowned with a diadem of shining gold, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the celestial visitors stooped to kiss Chiara as
her soul passed to its home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During all the life of Francis, whenever any
new movement or work was to be undertaken,
he invariably sent to ask the counsel and the
prayers of Chiara.</p>

<p>The miraculous preservation of the body of
Santa Chiara is one of the articles of faith in
Assisi. In 1850&mdash;six hundred years after her
death&mdash;a tomb believed to be hers was found
and opened in the presence of a distinguished
group of ecclesiastics, among whom was Cardinal
Pecci, later Pope Leo XIII. In this tomb
a form is said to have been found, and it has
been placed in a reliquary of alabaster and
Carrara marble especially constructed for it.
This sanctuary is placed in the church of Santa
Chiara, in the crypt, behind a glass screen,
where candles are kept perpetually burning.
Lina Gordon Duff, writing the history of Assisi,
says of this curious spectacle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;As pilgrims stand before a grating in the
dimly lighted crypt, the gentle rustle of a nun&rsquo;s
dress is heard; slowly invisible hands draw the
curtain aside, and the body of Santa Chiara is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
seen lying in a glass case upon a satin bed, her
face clearly outlined against her black and
white veils, whilst her brown habit is drawn in
straight folds about her body. She clasps the
book of her Rule in one hand, and in the other
holds a lily with small diamonds shining on
the streamers.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 308px;">

<p class="caption noi"><small>SANTA CHIARA, THE DUOMO, ASSISI<br /> Amalia Dupr√©</small></p>
</div>

<p>In all these churches&mdash;the great convent
church, upper and lower, of the Franciscans
elaborately adorned with frescoes by Cimabue
and by Giotto; in the ancient Duomo; in Santa
Chiara and in Santa Maria degli Angeli&mdash;statues
of the two saints, Francis and Chiara,
are placed side by side. She shares all the
exaltation of his memory and the fulness of his
fame.</p>

<p>The strange problem of the stigmata has,
perhaps, never been absolutely solved. Canon
Knox Little says that as to the miracles of St.
Francis generally speaking, there is no intrinsic
improbability; that &ldquo;his holy life, his constant
communion with God, the abundant blessings
with which it pleased God to mark his
ministry, all point in the same direction.&rdquo; Latter-day
revelations of psychic science disclose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
contemporary facts of the power of mental influence
on the physical form that are, in many
instances, hardly less wonderful than this
alleged miracle of St. Francis. Whether the
story is accepted literally or only in a figurative
sense does not affect the transcendent power
of his influence. His entire life and work illustrate
the beauty of holiness. &ldquo;Art in its widest
sense gained a marvellous impulse from his
work and effort,&rdquo; says Canon Knox Little.
The French and Proven√ßal literature and the
schools of Byzantine art preceded the life of
Francis; but his influence imparted a powerful
wave of sympathetic and vital insight and awakened
a world of new sensibilities of feeling.
Indeed, it is a proverb of Italy, &ldquo;Without
Francis, no Dante.&rdquo; Certainly the life of Francis
was the inspiration of the early Italian
art. Cimabue and Giotto drew from the inspiration
of that unique and lovely life the
pictorial conceptions that have made Assisi the
cradle of Italian painting. The great works of
Giotto are in the lower church of the Franciscan
monastery. One of these frescoes represents
chastity as a maiden kneeling in a shrine,
while angels bring to her branches of palm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
Obedience is depicted as placing a yoke upon
the bowed figure of a priest, while St. Francis,
attended by two angels, looks on; Poverty,
whom Francis declared to be his bride, is pictured
as accompanied by Hope and Charity,
who give her in marriage to St. Francis, the
union being blessed by Christ, while the
heavenly Father and throngs of angels gaze
through the clouds on this nuptial scene. The
fresco called Gloriosus Franciscus is perhaps
the crowning work of Giotto. Francis is seen
in a beatitude of glory, with a richly decorated
banner bearing the cross and seven stars floating
above his head and bands of angels in the
air surrounding him. Canon Knox Little, alluding
to these interesting works of Giotto, says
that &ldquo;even in their faded glories they give an
immense interest to the lower church of Assisi.
No one can look at them now unmoved, or
wander on the hillside to the west of the little
city, with the rugged rocks above one&rsquo;s head, and
beneath one&rsquo;s feet the rich carpets of cyclamen,
and before one&rsquo;s eyes long dreamy stretches of
the landscape of Umbria, without being touched
by the feeling of that beautiful and loving life
devoted to God and man and nature, in utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
truth, which therefore left such an impress on
Christian art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Madonna and saints painted by Cimabue
are faded almost to the point of obliteration,
yet there still lingers about them a certain grace
and charm. The visitor to this Franciscan
monastery church realizes that he is beholding
the art which was the very pledge and prophecy
of the Renaissance, and he realizes, too, that
the Renaissance itself was the outgrowth of
the new vitality communicated to the world by
the life and character of St. Francis. He gave
to the world the realization of the living Christ;
he taught that religion was in action, not in
theology. He liberated the spirit; and when
this colossal church was being built (1228-53)
the artists who had felt the new thrill of life
opened by his teaching hastened to Assisi to
express their appreciation by their pictorial
work on its walls. The qualities of spiritual life&mdash;faith,
sacrifice, sympathy, and love&mdash;began,
for the first time, to be interpreted into artistic
expression.</p>

<p>The tomb of St. Francis is in the crypt of the
church. The stone sarcophagus containing his
body was discovered in 1818, and then placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
here in a little chamber especially prepared,
surrounded by an iron latticework with candles
perpetually burning.</p>

<p>From the sacristy of the lower church, stairs
ascend to the upper, with its beautiful nave
and transept with a high altar, and the choir
stalls. While the lower church with its great
arches is always dark, the upper is flooded with
light from vast windows. There is a series of
frescoed panels on either side, accredited to
pupils of Giotto, full of forcible action and
a glow of color. But the upper church, while
it is magnificent, lacks somewhat of that mystic
atmosphere one is so swiftly conscious of in
the gloom and mystery of the lower church.</p>

<p>Stretching behind the churches, along the
crest of the high hill, is the colossal monastery
itself, with that double row of arches and colonnades
that makes it so conspicuous a feature of
all the Umbrian valley. Formerly hundreds of
monks dwelt here; but the Italian government
suppressed this monastery in 1866, and since
that time it has been used as a school for boys.</p>

<p>The ancient Duomo, whose fa√ßade is of the
twelfth century, has three exquisite rose windows,
and on either side, as one approaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the high altar, stand the statues of St. Francis
and of Santa Chiara. In the little piazza in
front of the church is a bronze copy of Dupr√©&rsquo;s
famous statue of St. Francis.</p>

<p>The colossal church of Santa Maria degli
Angeli, with its magnificent dome, is a contrast,
indeed, to the primitive little Portiuncula where
Francis knelt in prayer, and which is now preserved
in the centre of this vast cathedral,&mdash;the
rude structure encased in marble, and
decorated, above the entrance, with a picture
by Overbeck, whose motive is St. Francis as he
stands, hushed and reverent, listening to the
voice that tells him to embrace poverty. There
is a fine Perugino in the church, representing
the Saviour. The cell in which St. Francis
died, enclosed in the little chapel which St.
<a name="tn380" id="tn380"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Bonaventuri'">Bonaventura</ins> built over it, is preserved in this
great cathedral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who was he that opened that door
in heaven?&rdquo; questions Canon Knox Little in
reference to St. Francis. &ldquo;Who was he that
gave that fresh life and thought? Who but the
man who had brought down in his own person
the living Christ into his century, who had
taught men again the love of God, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
love of man and the love of nature; who had
lifted the people out of their misery and degradation,
and awakened the church out of its
stiffness and worldliness; it was he, too, who
inspired, who may at most be said to have
created, Italian art,&mdash;the great St. Francis!
Such are the deep, such are the penetrating,
such are the far-reaching effects of sanctity.
If a soul is, by divine grace, given wholly to
God, it is impossible for us to say to what
heights it may attain, or what good, in every
region of human effort, it may do.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Perugia, the neighboring city only fifteen miles
from Assisi, is the metropolis of all this Umbrian
region. Like Assisi, it is a &ldquo;hill town,&rdquo; built
on an acropolis of rock, its foundations laid by
the Etruscans more than three thousand years
before the Christian era, and its atmosphere is
freighted with the records of artists and scholars.
The Perugians were the forerunners. They
held the secret of artifice in metals and gems;
they were architects and sculptors. The only
traces of their painting that have come down
to us are their works on sarcophagi, on vases
or funeral urns,&mdash;traces that indicate their gifts
for line and form. It was about 310 B.C. that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
all Umbria became a Roman province. The
colossal porta of Augustus&mdash;a gateway apparently
designed for the Cyclops&mdash;still retains its
inscription, &ldquo;Augustus Perusia.&rdquo; The imperishable
impress of the great Roman conqueror
is still seen in many places. Perugia was a firm
citadel, as is attested by the fact that Totila and
his army of Goths spent seven years in besieging
it. The centuries from the thirteenth to
the fifteenth inclusive, when it was under the
sway of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, were
years of tragic violence. Even the cathedral
became the scene of riot, and its interior was
entirely washed with wine, and it was reconsecrated
before it could be again used for holy
offices. The little piazza in front of the
cathedral, now dreaming in the sun, has been
the scene of strange and contrasting crises of
life. Strife and warfare have desolated it; the
footsteps of Bernardino of Siena have consecrated
it, as he passed within the great portals
to preach the gospel of peace. He was one of
the most potent of the Francescan disciples,
and Bernardino (born of the noble family of
the Albizzeschi, in 1380, in Siena, the year
after St. Catherine&rsquo;s death) for forty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
wandered over Italy, preaching peace and
repentance. Vespasiano da Bisticci, a contemporary
historian, records that Bernardino
&ldquo;converted and changed the minds and spirits
of men marvellously and had a wondrous power
in persuading men to lay aside their mortal
hatreds.&rdquo; Bernardino died at the age of sixty-four
in Aquila, and the towns in which he had
faithfully carried on his apostolic work placed
the sacred sign of the divine name (I.H.S.)
upon their gates and palaces, in his memory.
In the Sienese gallery is a portrait of San Bernardino
by Sano, painted in 1460, representing
the saint as the champion of the Holy Name,
with the inscription, &ldquo;I have manifested Thy
name to men.&rdquo; In one of his impressive and
wonderful sermons San Bernardino said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;There still remain many places for us to
make. Ah! for the love of God, love one
another. Alas! see you not that, if you love
the destruction one of the other you are ruining
your very selves? Ah! put this thing right for
the love of God. Love one another! What I
have done to make peace among you and to
make you like brothers, I have done with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
zeal I should wish my own soul to receive. I
have done it all to the glory of God. And let
no one think that I have set myself to do anything
at any person&rsquo;s request. I am only moved
by the bidding of God for His honor and glory.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Opposite the Duomo of Perugia, on the other
side of the piazza, is the Palazzo Municipio,
with a Gothic fa√ßade, a beautiful example of
thirteenth-century architecture. Here also is
the colossal fountain with three basins, decorated
with pictorial designs from the Bible by
Niccolo Pisano and Arnolfo of Florence, and
in the shadow of this fountain St. Dominic, St.
Francis, and St. Bernardino often met and held
converse.</p>

<p>Perugia easily reads her title clear to artistic
immortality in having been the home of Perugino,
the master of Raphael. Here he lived
for several years working with Pinturicchio in
the frescoes that adorn the Collegio del Cambio,
now held as a priceless treasure hall of art.
They still glow with rich coloring,&mdash;the Christ
seen on the Mount of Transfiguration; the
Mother and Child with the adoring magi; and
the chariot of the dawn driven by Apollo a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
century before Guido painted his &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo; in
the Palazzo <a name="tn385" id="tn385"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Rospigliosa'">Rospigliosi</ins> in Rome.</p>

<p>From the parapets of Perugia are views of
supreme poetic beauty. The play of light and
color on the picturesque hills and mountains
of the Umbrian country; the gray-green gleam
of olive orchards and the silver threads of winding
streams; the towers and ruins and castles
of a dozen towns and villages that crown the
slopes, and the violet shadows of deepening
twilight, with Assisi bathed in a splendor of
rose and gold,&mdash;all combine to make this an
ever-changing panorama for the poet and
painter.</p>

<p>No journey in Italy is quite like that to the
lovely Umbrian valley and its Jerusalem, Assisi,
the shrine which, with the single exception of
Rome, is the special place of pilgrimage for the
entire religious world. Perugia offers the charm
of art, and attracts the visitor, also, by an exceptional
degree of modern comfort and convenience;
but Assisi is the shrine before which
he kneels, where the footsteps of saints who
have knelt in prayer make holy ground, and
where he realizes anew the consecration of faith
and sacrifice. The very air is filled with divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
messages, and in lowly listening he will hear,
again, those wonderful and thrilling words of
St. Francis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;By the holy love which is in God I pray all
to put aside every obstacle, every care, every
anxiety, that they may be able to consecrate
themselves entirely to serve, love, and honor the
Lord God, with a pure heart and a sincere purpose,
which is what He asks above all things.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br /><br />

<span class="nob">THE GLORY OF A VENETIAN JUNE</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>I have been between Heaven and Earth since our arrival at Venice.
The Heaven of it is ineffable&mdash;never had I touched the skirts of so
celestial a place. The beauty of the architecture, the silver trails of
water up between all that gorgeous color and carving, the enchanting
silence, the music, the gondolas,&mdash;I mix it all up together, and maintain
that nothing is like it, nothing equal to it, no second Venice in the
world.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Browning</span>, in the June of 1850.<br />
</p>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> first glimpse of enchanted Venice, as her
towers and marble palaces rise wraith-like from
the sea, is an experience that can never fade
from memory. Like a mirage, like a vision
invoked by some incantation or magician&rsquo;s spell,
the scene prefigures itself, bringing a thrill of
some vague and undefined memory, as if a
breath floated by,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&ldquo;An odor from Dreamland sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes the ghost seem nigh me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of a splendor that came and went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a life lived somewhere,&mdash;I know not<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In what diviner sphere,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of memories that stay not and go not,&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></div></div>

<p class="noi">which eludes all translation into words. Nor
does the spell dissolve and vanish when put to
the test of one&rsquo;s actual sojourn in the Dream
City. It is an experience outside the boundaries
of the ordinary day and daylight world,
as if one were caught up into the ethereal realm
to find a city</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of gliding and wide-wayed silence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With room in the streets for the soul.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sense of remoteness from common life
could hardly be greater if one were suddenly
swept away to some far star, blazing in the
firmament; or if Charon had rowed him over
the mystic river and he had entered the
abodes of life on the plane beyond. Even the
hotel becomes an enchanted palace whose
salons, luxuriously decorated, open by long
windows on marble balconies overhanging the
Grand Canal. Dainty little tables piled with
current reading matter, in French, English,
and Italian, stand around; the writing-desks are
sumptuous, filled with every convenience of
stationery; and the matutinal coffee and rolls
are served the guest in any idyllic niche wherein
he chooses to ensconce himself, regardless of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the regulation <i>salle-√†-manger</i>. One looks across
the Grand Canal to the beautiful Church of
Santa Maria della Salute. The water plashes
against the marble steps as gondolas glide past;
the blue sky of Italy reflects itself in the waters
below, until one feels as if he were floating in
the air between sea and sky. In the heart of
the city, with throngs of people moving to and
fro, all is yet silence, save the cry of the gondolier,
the confused echo of voices from the
people who pass, and here and there the faint
call of a bird. No whir and rush of electric
cars and motors; no click of the horses&rsquo; feet on
the asphalt pavement&mdash;no pavement, indeed,
and no horses, no twentieth-century rush of life.
It is Venice, it is June, and the two combine
to make an illuminated chapter. To live in
Venice is like being domesticated in the heart
of an opal. How wonderful it is to drift&mdash;a
sky above and a sky below&mdash;on still waters at
sunset, with the Dream City mirrored in the
depths, every shade of gold and rose and amber
mirrored back,&mdash;the very atmosphere a sea of
color, recalling to one Ruskin&rsquo;s words that &ldquo;none
of us appreciate the nobleness and the sacredness
of color. Of all God&rsquo;s gifts to man,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
continues, &ldquo;color is the holiest, the most divine,
the most solemn. Color is the sacred and saving
element.&rdquo; If the enthusiasm in these words
savor of exaggeration, Venice is the place that
will lure one to forgetfulness of it. One is
simply conscious of being steeped in color and
revelling in a strange loveliness. One no longer
marvels at the glory of Tintoretto and Paolo
Veronese. They but interpreted on canvas the
shining reality. A charming writer on Venice
has well said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;The aspects of Venice are as various, as
manifold, as the hues held in solution upon her
waters beneath a sirocco sky. There is a perpetual
miracle of change; one day is not like
another, one hour varies from the next; there
is no stable outline such as one finds among
the mountains, no permanent vista, as in a
view across a plain. The two great constituents
of the Venetian landscape, the sea and the
sky, are precisely the two features in nature
which undergo most incessant change. The
cloud-wreaths of this evening&rsquo;s sunset will never
be repeated again; the bold and buttressed piles
of those cloud-mountains will never be built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
again just so for us; the grain of orange and
crimson that stains the water before our prow,
we cannot be sure that we shall look upon its
like again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One day is less like another in
Venice than anywhere else. The revolution of
the seasons will repeat certain effects; spring will
chill the waters to a cold, hard green; summer
will spread its breadth of golden light on palace
front and water way; autumn will come with its
pearly-gray sirocco days, and sunsets flaming
a sombre death; the stars of a cloudless winter
night, the whole vast dome of heaven, will
be reflected in the mirror of the still lagoon.
But in spite of this general order of the seasons,
one day is less like another in Venice than
anywhere else; the lagoon wears a different
aspect each morning when you rise, the sky
offers a varied composition of cloud each evening
as the sun sets. Words cannot describe
Venice, nor brush portray her ever-fleeting,
ever-varying charm. Venice is to be felt, not
reproduced; to live there is to live a poem,
to be daily surfeited with a wealth of beauty
enough to madden an artist to despair.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1882 that the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Dr. Phillips Brooks, later Bishop of Massachusetts,
visited Venice and wrote of San Marco:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Strange how there is nothing like St. Mark&rsquo;s
in Venice, nothing of the same kind as the great
church. It would have seemed as if, standing
here for so many centuries, and always profoundly
loved and honored, it would almost of
necessity have influenced the minds of the generations
of architects, and shown its power in
their works. But there seems to be no sign of
any such influence. It stands alone.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Dr. Brooks noted that Venice had &ldquo;two
aspects, one sensuous and self-indulgent, the
other lofty, spiritual, and even severe. Both
aspects,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;are in its history and
both are also in its art. Titian often represents
the former. The loftier, nobler Tintoretto gives
us the second. There is something in his greatest
pictures, as, for instance, in the Crucifixion,
at St. Rocco, which no other artist approaches.
The lordly composition gives us an impression
of intellectual grasp and vigor. The foreground
group of prostrate women is full of a tenderness.
The rich pearly light, which floods the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
glows with a solemn picturesqueness, and the
great Christ, who hangs like a benediction over
the whole, is vocal with a piety which no other
picture in the world displays. And the Presentation
of the Virgin, in Santa Maria dell&rsquo;Orto,
is the consummate presentation of that beautiful
subject, its beauty not lost in its majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of other pictures Dr. Brooks said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;In the Academia there is the sunshine of
three hundred years ago. Paris Bordone&rsquo;s
glowing picture of the Fisherman who brings
the Ring of St. Mark to the Doge, burned like
a ray of sunlight on the wall. Carpaccio&rsquo;s
delightful story of St. Ursula brought the old
false standards of other days back to one&rsquo;s mind,
but brought them back lustrous with the splendor
of summers that seemed forever passed, but
are perpetually here. Tintoretto&rsquo;s Adam and
Eve was, as it always is, the most delightful
picture in the gallery, and Pordenone&rsquo;s great
St. Augustine seemed a very presence in the
vast illuminated room.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Tennyson loved best, of all the pictures in
Venice, a Bellini,&mdash;a beautiful work, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
Church of Il Redentore; and he was deeply
impressed by the &ldquo;Presentation of the Virgin,&rdquo;
from Tintoretto, in the Church of the Madonna
dell&rsquo;Orto. &ldquo;He was fascinated by St. Mark&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
writes the poet&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;by the Doge&rsquo;s Palace
and the Piazza, and by the blaze of color in
water and sky. He climbed the Campanile,
and walked to the library where he could
scarcely tear himself away from the Grimani
Breviary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Venice, though not containing any single
gallery comparable with the Pitti and the
Uffizi, is still singularly rich in treasures of art,
and rich in legend and story. The school of
encrusted architecture is nowhere so wonderfully
represented as here, and it is only in this
architecture that a perfect scheme of color decoration
is possible. In all the world there is no
such example of encrusted architecture as that
revealed in St. Mark&rsquo;s. It is a gleaming mass
of gold, opal, ruby, and pearl; with alabaster
pillars carved in designs of palm and pomegranate
and lily; with legions of sculptured
angels looking down; with altars of gold ablaze
with scarlet flowers and snowy lilies, while
clouds of mystic incense fill the air. One most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
impressive place is the baptistery, where is the
tomb of St. Mark and also that of the Doge
Andrea Dandolo, who died at the age of forty-six,
having been chosen Doge ten years before.
His tomb is under a window in the baptistery,
and the design is that of his statue in bronze,
lying on a couch, while two angels at the head
and the feet hold back the curtains.</p>

<p>The sarcophagus that is said to contain the
body of St. Mark is of the richest description, encrusted
with gold and jewels on polished ebony
and marble. There is a legend that after St.
Mark had seen the people of Aguilia well
grounded in religion he was called to Rome by
St. Peter; but before setting off he took with
him in a boat the holy Bishop Hennagoras and
sailed to the marshes of Venice. The boat was
driven by wind to a small island called Rialto,
on which were some houses, and St. Mark was
suddenly snatched into ecstasy and heard the
voice of an angel saying, &ldquo;Peace be to thee,
Mark; here shall thy body rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is also a legend that in the great conflagration
which destroyed Venice in 976 A.D.,
the body of St. Mark was lost and no one knew
where to find it. Then the pious Doge and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
people gave themselves to fasting and prayer,
and assembled in the church, asking that the
place be revealed them. It was on the 25th
of June that the assemblage took place. Suddenly
one of the pillars of the church trembled,
and opened to disclose the sarcophagus,&mdash;a
chest of bronze. The legend goes on to say
that St. Mark stretched his hand out through the
side and that a noble, Dolfini by name, drew a
gold ring off the finger.</p>

<p>The place where this miracle is said to have
been wrought is now marked by the Altar of
the Cross.</p>

<p>Ruskin declares that &ldquo;a complete understanding
of the sanctity of color is the key to
European art.&rdquo; Nowhere is this sanctity of
color so felt as at San Marco. The church is
like the temple of the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The origin of Venice is steeped in sacred history.
It is pre-eminently the city founded in
religious enthusiasm. The chronicles of De
Monici, written in 421, give this passage: &ldquo;God,
who punishes the sins of men by war, sorrow,
and whose ways are past finding out, willing
both to save the innocent blood, and that a
great power, beneficial to the whole world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
should arise in a place strange beyond belief,
moved the chief men of the cities of the Venetian
province both in memory of the past, and
in dread of future distress, to establish states
upon the nearer islands of the Adriatic, to which,
in the last extremity, they might retreat for
refuge.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They laid the foundation of the
new city under good auspices on the island of
the Rialto, the highest and nearest to the mouth
of the Brenta, on March 25, 471.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first Doge of Venice was Paolo Lucio
<a name="tn399" id="tn399"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Anopeste'">Anafesto</ins>, elected by the tribunal of commonalty,
tribunals, and clergy, at Heraclea, in
697. The period of the subjection of the
ecclesiastical to the ducal and patrician powers
followed. The &ldquo;Council of Ten&rdquo; was established
in 1335, and the last Doge elected was
Lodovico Manin in 1789, who exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Tol√®
questo: no la doper√≤ pi√π</i>,&rdquo; as the French Revolution
destroyed the Republic of Venice.</p>

<p>The finest example of Renaissance architecture
in Venice is that of the <i>Libreria Vecchia</i>,
the work of Jacobo Sansovino, completed in
the sixteenth century. Never were the creations
of poet and philosopher more fittingly enshrined.
The rich Doric frieze, the Ionic columns, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
stately balustrade, with statues and obelisks,
the resplendent richness of ornamentation, offer
a majesty and beauty seldom found even in the
best classical architecture of Europe. On the
ceiling of one sala is a picture by Titian representing
&ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; as a woman, reclining on a
cloud, her right hand outstretched to take a
book that Genius is offering her. There are
two beautiful caryatides by Vittoria and rich
mural work by <a name="tn400a" id="tn400a"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Battesta'">Battista</ins> Franco and De Moro.</p>

<p>Petrarca, returning from his wanderings in
1362, pleaded with the Senate of Venezia
to give him a house, in return for which he
offered the inheritance of his library. This was
the nucleus of the fine collection which since
1812 has been included in the Palace of the
Doges. In it are some magnificent works by
Paolo Veronese, one portrait by Tintoretto, and
others by Salviati and Telotti.</p>

<p>The Doge&rsquo;s Palace is a treasure house of history.
One enters the Porta <a name="tn400b" id="tn400b"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'delta'">della</ins> Carta, which
dates back to 1638, erected by Bartolomeo
Buon. The portal is very rich in sculpture,
and among the reliefs is a heroic one of Francesco
Foscari, kneeling before the lion at St.
Mark&rsquo;s. One recalls his tragic fate and passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
on. Perhaps, <i>en passant</i>, one may say that his
pilgrimage through Venice and Florence is so
constantly in the scenes of tragedy that he is
prone to sink almost into utter sadness, even,
rather than seriousness. The air is full of
ghosts. One feels the oppression of all the life
that has there been lived, all the tragedies that
have been enacted in these scenes.</p>

<p>In Renaissance nothing more wonderful in
Europe can be found than the court of the
Palace of the Doges. Antonio Rizzo began the
east fa√ßade of the building in 1480, and it was
continued by Lombardo, and completed by
Scarpagnino. &ldquo;Words cannot be found to
praise the beauty of these sculptures,&rdquo; says Salvatico,
&ldquo;as well as of the single ornaments of
the walls and of the ogres which have been
carved so delicately and richly that they cannot
be excelled by the Roman antique friezes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the golden staircase one goes to the council
chambers,&mdash;the hall of the Senate, the Council
of Ten, and the Council of Three. In the great
council chamber is that most celebrated mural
painting in the world, &ldquo;The Glory of Venice,&rdquo;
by Paolo Veronese, which covers the ceiling. In
a frieze are the portraits of seventy-six of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Doges, but in one space is a black tablet only,
with the inscription: &ldquo;This in place of M. F.,
who was executed for his crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Sala del Maggior Consiglio&rdquo; (hall of
the grand council) is very rich in paintings.
Above the throne is Tintoretto&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Glory of
Paradise,&rdquo; and the walls are covered with battle
pieces and symbolic and allegorical paintings.
There is &ldquo;Venice Crowned by Fame,&rdquo; by Paolo
Veronese, &ldquo;Doge Niccol√≤ da Ponte Presenting
the Senate and Envoys of Conquered Cities
to Venice,&rdquo; by Tintoretto; &ldquo;Venice Crowned by
the Goddess of Victory,&rdquo; by Palma Giovane,
and many another of the richest and most wonderful
beauty.</p>

<p>Descending into the prisons and dungeons
brings one into a vivid realization of the grim
history of which these were the scenes. The
Bridge of Sighs has two covered passages, one
for the political and one for the criminal prisoners.
Here is shown a narrow ledge on which
the condemned man stood, with a slanting stone
passageway before him, which, when the guillotine
had done its swift and deadly work, conveyed
the crimson flood into the dark waters
of the canal below, while the body was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
in the water on the other side. There are the
&ldquo;Chambers of Lead,&rdquo; where prisoners were confined,
intensely hot in the summer, and as
intensely cold in the winter. Many of these
dark, close, narrow cells&mdash;in which the one
article of furniture allowed was the wooden
slanting rack, that served as a bed&mdash;still remain.
In many of these are inscriptions that
were written by the prisoners. One reads (in
translation): &ldquo;May God protect me against him
whom I trust; I will protect myself against him
whom I do not trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The murderer, Giovanni M. Borni, wrote in
his cell: &ldquo;G. M. B. was confined very unjustly
in this prison; if God does not help it will be
the last desolation of a poor, numerous, and
honest family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All visitors to these gloomy dungeons recall
the lines of Byron:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I stood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A palace and a prison on each hand.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The piazza of St. Mark&rsquo;s is a distinctive
feature, even in all Europe. It is not large; it
is surrounded on three sides with shops, which
are merely glittering bazaars of jewels and bric-a-brac;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
the sidewalk is blockaded with caf√©s <i>al
fresco</i>, the ground is half covered with the dense
flocks of white doves, but here all lingers and
loiters. The fa√ßade of St. Mark&rsquo;s fills one end&mdash;a
mass of gleaming color. At one corner
is the tall clock tower (Torre dell&rsquo;Orologio)
in the Renaissance style of 1400, crowned with
the gilded lion of St. Mark. On the festa days
three figures, the Three Wise Men, preceded
by an angel, come forth on the tower and bow
before the Madonna, in a niche above,&mdash;a very
ingenious piece of mechanism. With its rich
architecture and sculptures and masses of color,
the piazza of San Marco is really an open-air
hall, where all the town congregates from morning
till midnight.</p>

<p>To study the art of the Venetian school is a
work of months, and one that would richly
repay the student. The churches and galleries
of Venice give a truly unique opportunity. In
the Church of San Sebastiano lies Paolo Veronese,
the church in which he painted his celebrated
frescoes, now transformed into a temple
for himself. Here one finds his &ldquo;Coronation
of the Virgin,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Virgin in the Gloria,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Adoration of the Magi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Martyrdom of San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
Sebastian,&rdquo; and many others. In the Scuola
di San Rocco are the great works of Tintoretto,
&ldquo;St. Magdalene in the Wilderness,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Visitation,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Murder of the Innocents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the San Maria dei Frari is the tomb of
Titian,&mdash;an exquisite grouping of sculpture in
Carrara marble, erected in 1878-80 by the command
of the Emperor of Austria, the work of
Zandomenighi. In this church is Titian&rsquo;s most
famous painting, the &ldquo;Madonna of the Pessaro,&rdquo;
the work of which is probably, too, the greatest
in all Venetian art. The Hall of Heaven is
shown, supported by colossal columns. St.
Peter, <a name="tn405" id="tn405"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Maucis'">Francis</ins>, and Antoninus are commending
the Pessaro family to the Virgin, who is enthroned
on high. The beauty of line, the splendor
of color, and the marvellous composition
render this immortal masterpiece something
whose sight marks an epoch in life. Canova&rsquo;s
tomb in San Maria dei Frari is a wonderful
thing. It is a pyramid of purest marble, with
a door opening for the sarcophagus, above which
is a portrait of Canova in relief, and on either
side the door angels and symbolic figures are
sculptured.</p>

<p>The Church of Santa Maria della Salute, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
which one is always returning, is a wonderful
example of artistic architecture, as its snowy
towers and dome seem to rise out of the water
and float in the air.</p>

<p>The fall of the Campanile in 1904 was regarded
as a calamity by all the civilized world.
For a thousand years it had stood at the side of
St. Mark&rsquo;s; but the disaster aroused the attention
of experts to the condition of the great
cathedral itself, and it was found that the vast
area of over fifty thousand square feet of matchless
mosaic needed restoration in order that
they should be preserved.</p>

<p>The Palazzo Rezzonico, which dates to Clement
XIII, usually known as the &ldquo;Browning
Palace,&rdquo; has been for many years one of the
special interests to the visitor in Venice. In
the early months of 1907 it passed out of the
hands of Robert Barrett Browning, who had
purchased it in 1888, and had held it sacredly,
with its poetic and personal associations, since
the death of his father, the poet, in 1889. To
Mr. Barrett Browning is due the grateful appreciation
of a multitude of tourists for his generous
and never-failing courtesy in permitting
them the privilege of visiting this palace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
which his father had passed many months of
enjoyment. It was from this residence that
the poet Browning wrote, in October of 1880,
to a friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Every morning at six I see the sun rise; far
more wonderfully, to my mind, than his famous
setting which everybody glorifies. My bedroom
window commands a perfect view; the
still, gray lagune, the few sea-gulls flying, the
islet of San Giorgio in deep shadow and the
clouds in a long purple rock behind which a
sort of spirit of rose burns up till presently all
the rims are on fire with gold, and last of all
the orb sends before it a long column of its
own essence apparently; so my day begins.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Later, of his son&rsquo;s palace, Mr. Browning
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Have I told you that there is a chapel which
he has restored in honor of his mother&mdash;putting
up there the inscription by Tommaseo,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
now above Casa Guidi in Florence?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>
<p>In this palace Mr. Browning wrote some of
his later poems, and it may well be that it was
when he was clad in his singing robes that he
perhaps most deeply felt the ineffable charm of
Venice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For the stars help me, and the sea bears part;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The very night is clinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closer to Venice&rsquo; streets to leave one space<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Above me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was from these lofty salons in the Browning
Palace that the poet passed to the &ldquo;life
more abundant&rdquo; on that December day of
1889, on the very day that his last volume,
&ldquo;Asolando,&rdquo; was published and also the last
volume of Tennyson&rsquo;s. Regarding these Mr.
Gladstone said, in a letter to Lord Tennyson:
&ldquo;The death of Browning on the day of the
appearance of your volume, and we hear of
one of his own, is a touching event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the time of Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s death in
Florence (in June of 1861) Mr. Browning never
felt that he could see Italy again, until the
autumn of 1878, when he, with his sister, Miss
Sarianna Browning, came to Venice by way
of the Italian lakes and Verona. At this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
they only remained for a fortnight, domiciled
in the old Palazzo Brandolin-Rota, which was
transformed into the Albergo dell&rsquo;Universo.
This palace was on the Grand Canal below
the Accad√©mia, and here he returned through
two or three subsequent years. Mr. Browning
became very fond of Venice, and he explored
its winding ways and gardens and knew it,
not merely from the gondola view, but from
the point of view of the curious little dark
and narrow byways, the bridges, and the
piazzas.</p>

<p>It was in 1880 that Mr. Browning first met,
through the kind offices of Mr. Story, a most
charming and notable American lady, Mrs.
Arthur Bronson (Katherine DeKay), who had
domiciled herself in Casa Alvisi, an old palace
on the Grand Canal opposite the Church of
Santa Maria della Salute. She was a woman
of very interesting personality, and had drawn
about her a circle including many of the most
distinguished people of her time, authors, artists,
poets, and notable figures in the social world.
She was eminently <i>simpatica</i> and her lovely impulses
of generous kindness were rendered possible
to translate into the world of the actual by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
the freedom which a large fortune confers on
its possessor. Between Mrs. Bronson and Mr.
Browning there sprang up one of those rare
and beautiful friendships that lasted during his
lifetime, and to her appreciation and many
courtesies he owed much of the happiness of
his later years. In the autumn of 1880 Mrs.
Bronson made Mr. Browning and his sister her
guests, placing at their disposal a suite of rooms
in the Palazzo Giustiniani Recanati&mdash;a palace
adjoining her own&mdash;and each night they dined
and passed the evening with her, with music
and conversation to enchant the hours. After
Mr. Browning&rsquo;s death, Mrs. Bronson was the
friend whom all pilgrims to his shrine in Venice
felt it a special privilege to meet and to hear
speak of him. In her palace was a large easy-chair,
with a ribbon tied across the arms, in
which Browning was accustomed to sit, and
which was held sacred to him. Mrs. Bronson
was an accomplished linguist, and the <i>habitu√©s</i>
of her salon represented many nationalities.
Among these was the Princess Montenegro, the
mother of the present Queen of Italy.</p>

<p>It is little wonder that the Browning Palace
was for so many years a focus for all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
revered and loved the wedded poets, Robert and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.</p>

<p>In the marble court, roofed only by the blue
Venetian sky, stood Mr. Barrett Browning&rsquo;s
statue of &ldquo;Dryope&rdquo; in bronze, on its marble
pedestal,&mdash;a beautiful conception of the Dryope
of Keats,&mdash;the dweller in forest solitudes
whom the Hamadryads transformed into a
poplar. Here a fountain makes music all day
long, and the court is also adorned in summer
by great Venetian jars of pink hydrangeas in
full bloom. The grand staircase, with its carved
balustrade and the wide landing where a rose
window decorates the wall, leads to the lofty
salons which were yet as homelike as they were
artistic during the residence of the Brownings.
Mr. Story&rsquo;s bust of Mrs. Browning, other portrait
busts of both the poets, sculptured by
their artist son, and by others, and other memorials
abound. In the library were gathered
many interesting volumes, autographed from
their authors, and many rare and choice editions,
among which was one of the &ldquo;Sonnets
from the Portuguese&rdquo; in a sumptuous volume
whose artistic beauty found a fitting setting to
Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s immortal sonnets. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
other volumes were a collection of signed
&ldquo;Etchings&rdquo; by Sir Laurence Alma-Tadema;
presentation copies from Tennyson, Matthew
Arnold, Aubrey De Vere, Walter Savage Landor,
and many another known to fame; and a copy,
also, of a study of Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s poetry<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> by
an American writer.</p>

<p>There is one memento over which the visitor
always smiled&mdash;a souvenir of a London evening
in 1855 when the Brownings had invited
Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his brother and
Lord Madox Brown to meet Tennyson and
listen to his reading of his new poem, &ldquo;Maud,&rdquo;
then still unpublished. During the reading Rossetti
drew a caricature representing Tennyson
with his hair standing on end, his eyes glowering
and his hand theatrically extended, as he
held a manuscript inscribed,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I hate the dreadful hollow behind the little wood.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A reproduction of John Singer Sargent&rsquo;s
painting, &ldquo;The Gypsy Dance,&rdquo; bore the inscription,
&ldquo;To <i>mon ami</i>, Browning.&rdquo; From the
library is a niche, decorated in gold, with memorial
entablatures to the memory of Mrs. Brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>ing.
On the outer wall of the palace is an
inscription that runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Robert Browning died in this house 12th
December, 1889.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Open my heart and you will see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Graven inside it &lsquo;Italy.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is a sadness in the fact that this palace,
consecrated to the memory of the immortal
poets, husband and wife, has passed into the
hands of strangers; but that is a part of the play
in a world in which we have no continuing
city. In the spring of 1905, Miss Sarianna
Browning died in the home of her nephew,
near Florence, and her body was buried in the
new Protestant cemetery in that city; the old
one, where all that was mortal of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning was laid to rest, being now
closed. Mr. Barrett Browning, in his Tuscan
villa, is again dwelling near Florence, his native
city, which must forever hold to him its atmosphere
of consecrated beauty as the beloved
home of his mother,&mdash;the noblest and greatest
of all woman poets.</p>

<p>The centenary of Carlo Goldoni was celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
in Venice in the spring of 1907 by the
publication of all his works and a monograph
on his life; an exhibition of personal relics; the
presentation of one of his dramas set to music
by Baldassare Galuppi, the great Venetian
composer of his time, and by a procession to
lay a wreath of laurel on his monument in the
Campo San Bartolommeo. The drama given,
entitled the &ldquo;Buranello,&rdquo; was the last work of
the author, and it was presented in the theatre
Goldoni. The Municipal Council of Venice
voted the sum of fifty thousand lire for the <i>√©dition
de luxe</i>, which consists of twenty volumes, in
octavo. In each volume is a different portrait
of Goldoni, facsimile of manuscripts, and the
reproduction of literary curiosities.</p>

<p>The monograph of Goldoni was issued by the
press of the Venetian Institute of Graphic Art
in a limited number of copies.</p>

<p>It contains more than three hundred printed
pages and a series of very interesting illustrations.
Among these are the reproductions
of ancient engravings which are most rare
(such as the view of the Grimani Theatre
at San Giovanni Crisostomo, a famous theatre
existing in the days of the Venetian republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
but now demolished), frontispieces of destroyed
editions, and other personal memorials. The
revival of the splendid work of the famous artist
was one of the attractions of the festa of celebration.
The art exhibition of Venice in this
spring of 1907 was very picturesque. One
special salon was allotted to the artists of Great
Britain, and there was a fine loan collection of
the portraits of English noblemen painted by
Mr. Sargent. This salon was decorated with
panels by Frank Brangwyn.</p>

<p>Venice forever remains a dream, a mirage, an
enchantment. Has it a recognized social life,
with &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; that come and go? Has it
trade, commerce, traffic? Has it any existence
save on the artist&rsquo;s canvas, in the poet&rsquo;s vision?
Has it a resident population to whom it is a
home, and not the pilgrimage of passionate
pilgrims?</p>

<p>There are those who find this Venice of all
the year round a society of stately nobles whose
ancestral claims are identified with the history
of the city and who are at home in its palaces
and gondolas, but of this resident life the
visitor is less aware than of that in any other
city in Italy. For him it remains forever in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
his memory as the crowning glory of June evenings
when the full, golden moon hangs over
towers and walls, when gondolas freighted with
Venetian singers loom up out of the shadows
and fill the air with melody that echoes as in
dreams, and that vanishes&mdash;one knows not
when or where. Mr. Howells, in his delightful
&ldquo;Venetian Days,&rdquo; has interpreted much of that
life that the tourist never recognizes, that eludes
his sight; and the Dream City still, to the visitor
who comes and goes, shrouds itself in myth
and mystery. One of the poetic visions of
Venice is that given in Robert Underwood
Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Browning at Asolo&rdquo; (inscribed to
Mrs. Arthur Bronson), of which the opening
stanzas run:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;This is the loggia Browning loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">High on the flank of the friendly town;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The Temple flashing with opal fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bubble and foam of the sunlit sea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Edgar Fawcett, always enchanted with his
Venetian days, pictures the northern lagoon,
some six miles from Venice, as &ldquo;a revel of
pastoral greenness, with briery hedges, numberless
wild flowers and the most captivating of
sinuous creeks, overarched by an occasional
bridge, so old that you greet with respect every
moss-grown inch of its drowsy and sagging
brickwork. The cathedral, the ineludible cathedral
of all Italian settlements, is reached after a
short ramble, and you enter it with mingled
awe and amusement,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Some of
its mosaics, representing martyrs being devoured
by flames and evidently enjoying themselves a
great deal during this mortuary process, challenge
the disrespectful smile. But others are
vested with a rude yet sacred poetry, and certain
semi-Oriental marble sculptures, adjacent
to the altar, would make an infidel feel like
crossing himself for the crime of having
yielded to a humorous twinge. This duomo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
dates far back beyond the Middle Ages, and
so does the small Church of Santa Fosca, only
a step away. What renders Torcello so individual
among all the islands and islets of the
lagoon, I should say, is her continual contrast
between the ever-recurrent idyllicism of open
meadows or wilding clusters of simple rustic
thickets, and the enormous antiquity of these
two hoary ecclesiastic fanes. History is in
the air, and you feel that the very daisies
you crush underfoot, the very copses from
which you pluck a scented spray, have their
delicate rustic ancestries, dating back to Attila,
who is said once to have brought his destructive
presence where now such sweet solemnity
of desertion and quietude unmolestedly
rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>History and legend and art and romance meet
and mingle to create that indefinable sorcery of
Venice. It is like nothing on earth except a
poet&rsquo;s dream, and his poetic dream is of the
ethereal realm. The wonderful music that
floats over the &ldquo;silver trail&rdquo; of still waters;
the mystic silences; the resplendence of color,&mdash;all,
indeed, weave themselves into an incantation
of the gods; it is the ineffable loveliness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Paradise where the rose of morning glows &ldquo;and
the June is always June,&rdquo; and it is no more
earth, but a celestial atmosphere,&mdash;this glory
of June in Venice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br /><br />

<span class="nob">THE MAGIC LAND</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>More than five hundred years have passed over the country of Dante
since the death of his mortal part&mdash;years of glory and of shame, of genius
and intolerable mediocrity, of turbulent liberty and mortal servitude; but
the name of Dante has remained, and the severe image of the poet still
rules the destinies of Italian generations, now an encouragement and now
a reproach. The splendor of no other genius has been able to eclipse or
dim the grandeur of Dante; never has there been a darkness so profound
that it could conceal this star of promise from Italian eyes; neither the
profanations of tyrants and Jesuits, nor the violations of foreign invaders,
have been able to efface it. &ldquo;<i>Sanctum Poet√¶ nomen quod nunquam barbaries
violavit.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Mazzini.</span><br />
</p></div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> true life of Italy is not read in any record
of contemporary facts or statistics. Mazzini
once said of Dante, in an essay on the immortal
poet, that &ldquo;the life, the true life of Dante does
not lie in the series of the material facts of his
existence. The life of Dante consists in the
sufferings and aspirations of his soul; in its
dominant impulses; in the ceaseless development
of the idea which was at once his guide,
inspiration, and consolation; in his belief as a
man and as an Italian.&rdquo; The real life of Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
is, by analogy, to be read in that atmosphere
of aspiration and of noble purpose which characterizes
the nation rather than in the material
facts of its general progress at the present time.
As a country Italy is young. It is still less than
forty years since her unity was declared, and to
merge the large number of separate States into
one harmonious whole is a task requiring the
evolutionary progress of time; for a nation, like
a university, cannot be a matter of instantaneous
creation. It must germinate and grow.
The country that, previous to so comparatively
a recent date as the year 1870, was, in the phrasing
of Prince Metternich, &ldquo;a geographical expression,&rdquo;
can hardly be judged by present
national standards after an existence of only
thirty-seven years, although it need be said in
no spirit of apology; for Italy is advancing in
scientific development, in manufactures, and in
the problems involved in civil and hydraulic
engineering to a notable degree in the northern
part. Milan and Naples are separated by far
more than geographical distance. In modern
progress Milan is divided by centuries from all
Southern Italy.</p>

<p>Between Italy and the United States the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
<i>entente cordiale</i> is not merely that of diplomatic
and ceremonial courtesy, but of an exceptional
degree of mutually sympathetic comprehensions.
In noble ambitions and lofty purposes Americans
and Italians are closely akin. In zeal for
contemporary scientific progress, in an intense
susceptibility to the glories of art, and in hospitality
to all that makes for progress, both
nations meet in mutual recognition. Of no
people is it more deeply true than of Americans
that &ldquo;each man has two countries: his own
and Italy.&rdquo; The average traveller sees this
fair land with a breadth and thoroughness seldom
called into requisition elsewhere. In England
he is usually content with London, the
tour of the cathedral towns and the lake region
of the poets. France is summed up to him in
Paris and in the chateaux of outlying districts.
But Italy beguiles the traveller into every lonely
foot-trail in the mountains; to every &ldquo;piazza
grande&rdquo; of lonely hamlets, isolated on a rocky
hillside; to every &ldquo;fortezza&rdquo; that crowns a
mountain summit. The unexplored byways of
Italy are magnetic in their fascination, and one
special source of congratulation on the part of
those fortunate tourists who travel with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
own motor car is that they are thus enabled to
penetrate into untrodden byways in Italy in a
manner impossible to those who must depend
entirely on the regulation railroad service. All
lovers of Italy are devoted to these original
tours of private exploration. A recent trip to
<a name="tn426" id="tn426"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Saricinesco'">Saracinesco</ins>, in the region of Tivoli, was made
by Mrs. Stetson (Grace Ellery Channing) with
her husband, and in a descriptive record of the
little journey into an unfrequented mountain
region this paragraph occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Roused by &lsquo;an awful rose of dawn&rsquo; which
turned every solemn slope to strange amber and
amethyst, we left that rocky eyrie next day,
returning by way of Anticoli&mdash;beloved of artists.
And if the ascent had qualified us for
Alpine climbers, the descent qualified us as
members of the Italian cavalry corps. Pictures
of officers riding down the face of cliffs will
never impress us again; we know now it is the
very simplest of &lsquo;stunts.&rsquo; Our way down was diversified
by the tinkling of thousands of sheep-bells,
by the far too close proximity of bulls to
Maria&rsquo;s crimson headdress, which nothing in
the world would induce her to remove, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
sundry meetings with relations, long-unseen
friends, and strangers, from whom we culled
the whole register of deaths, births, marriages,
and happenings for a month past. At last,
beside a little bridge near the railroad station,
Leonardo addressed his ten-thousandth adjuration
to Beppino, whose poor little legs trembled
under him. It was no longer, &lsquo;Ah, sacred one!&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see Anticoli!&rsquo;&mdash;or &lsquo;the rock,&rsquo;
or whatever it might be; now he said, &lsquo;Ah,
sacred one!&mdash;don&rsquo;t you comprehend?&mdash;the
Signora descends&rsquo;&mdash;and Beppino looked distinctly
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we demanded the reckoning, skilfully
evaded hitherto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well&mdash;a franc for each beast,&mdash;and half
a franc for the room,&mdash;the rest was nothing&mdash;a
<i>sciocchezza</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A franc apiece!&mdash;half a franc!&mdash;were <i>we</i>
brigands that we should do this thing?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This typical picture of idyllic days in Italy,
enjoyed in the impromptu excursion and trip,
reveals the delicacy of feeling and the sunny
kindness that characterize the <i>contadini</i> and
which imparts to any social contact with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
a grace and sweetness peculiar to Italian life.
There are parts of Italy where it is still the
Middle Ages and no hint of the twentieth
century has yet penetrated. The modern spirit
has almost taken possession of Rome; it is
largely in evidence in Florence and even
Venice, and it dominates Milan; but in most
of the &ldquo;hill towns&rdquo; and in the little hamlets
and lonely haunts where a house is perhaps
improvised out of the primeval rock, the
prevailing life is still medi√¶val, and only
awakens on festa days into any semblance of
activity.</p>

<p>Somewhere, away up in the hills, several
miles from Pegli,&mdash;on the Mediterranean coast
near Genoa,&mdash;is one of these sequestered little
hill towns called <i>Acqua Sacra</i>. The name is
obvious, indeed, for the sound of the &ldquo;sacred
water&rdquo; fills the air, falling from every hillside
and from the fountain of the <i>acqua sacra</i> by
the church. Pilgrims come from miles around
to drink of these waters. Each house in this
remote little hamlet is of solid stone, resembling
a fortress on a small scale, and the houses cling
to the hillsides like mosses to a rock. Though
far up in the mountains, the hills rise around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
the hamlet like city walls, as if the life of all
the world were kept outside. The unforeseen
visit to these remote hamlets, suddenly chancing
upon some small centre of happy and half-idyllic
life, is one of the charms of tourist travel
in this land of ineffable loveliness.</p>

<p>The approach to Italy, by whatever direction,
by land or by sea, one enters, is one of magical
beauty. Whether one enters from the Mediterranean
or from the Adriatic, or by means of
the Mont Cenis, the Simplon, or the St. Gothard
pass, through the sublime mountain wall, each
gateway is marvellous in attraction. Approaching
from the seas that completely surround Italy
except on one side, the almost undreamed-of
splendor of Naples, Genoa, and Venice, as seen
from off the shore, exceeds all power of painter
or poet to reproduce. The precipitous coast
of Sicily; the picturesque city of Palermo;
the wonderful ruins of the Greek theatre on
the heights in Taormina,&mdash;all enchant the
tourist. To anchor off Naples, in the beautiful
bay, serves the purpose of an hotel out at
sea. It is like living in Venice&mdash;only more so!
By the little rowboats one may go, at any moment,
to Naples, and it is more delightful than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
passing the days in the city itself. For at
night as one strolls or sits on deck what a picture
is before the eye! All Naples, on her
semicircular shores, with her terraced heights
rising above, defined in a blaze of electric
lights! Genoa, <i>la Superba</i>, is still more magnificent
when seen from the sea; and Venice,
rising dream-enchanted, completes the wonders
of the approach by water.</p>

</div>

<p>As the new Italy has not yet achieved any
homogeneous unity, Naples, Rome, Florence,
Venice, and Milan differ in their characteristics
to such a degree that no general interpretation
of the residents of any one would appropriately
describe those of another. Paris and Vienna
hardly differ as much as do Milan and Rome;
and Venice, Florence, and Rome, each rich in
art treasures, have little else in common. Certain
characteristics of each of the large cities
reveal themselves prominently, even to a superficial
observer. Milan, as has been said, is
a centre of activity, as Florence is of culture
and accomplishments. Florence has the largest
and the most choice circulating library in all
Italy and one that ranks among the best on the
Continent. Her galleries are treasure stores of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
art, and her social life is unsurpassed&mdash;one
might almost say unrivalled&mdash;in its fine quality.
Music, philosophic culture, learning in all
lines of research characterize Florentine society.
Education has always been regarded in Florence
as a matter of prime importance, and when the
government grant of funds is insufficient the
sum is made up by private contributions, so
that the <i>Scuola del Popolo</i> gives free instruction,
yearly, to eighteen hundred pupils, in every
branch of technical and art education. This
fact alone offers its own explanation of that
general intelligence of the people which so impresses
the visitor in Florence. But this is a
municipal rather than national fact. Every
special development in any direction in Italy
will always be found to be the characteristic of
the city or locality, not of the country as a
whole; and thus the unity of Italy is still a
political expression rather than a political fact.
It is a theory which is not yet developed into
an experience. Italy is in the making. Practically,
she is the youngest of countries, with
less than forty years of experimental attempt at
<i>national</i> life behind her. Not until 1919 will
she have attained the first half century of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
united life. Educational facilities, inclusive of
schools, libraries, and museums; railroads, telegraph
and telephone service, electric lighting
and electric trams,&mdash;all the ways and means
of the modern mechanism of life are, inevitably,
in a nebulous state in Italy. The political
situation is extremely interesting at the present
time. That the &ldquo;Blacks&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Whites&rdquo;
are diametrically opposed to each other is in
the nature of history rather than that of contemporary
record or of prophecy; and that this
is a traditional attitude in this city of the C√¶sars
is not a fact by any means unknown; but the situation
is complicated by the third party&mdash;the
Socialists&mdash;who, by allying themselves with
either, would easily turn the scales and command
the situation. If they were ardent Catholics
and were advocates of the Papal supremacy,
the temporal power of the Pope would be restored
in less time almost than could be recorded, and
Pius X would be in residence in the Palazzo
Quirinale rather than Victor Emanuele III.
But this great modern uprising in Italy&mdash;a
movement that is gathering force and numbers
so rapidly that no one can venture to prophesy
results even in the comparatively immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
future&mdash;this great modern movement is neither
for church nor state. The Socialist uprising is
very strong in Milan and through Northern
Italy. It is much in evidence in the Umbrian
region&mdash;in Foligno, Spoleto, Nervi, and those
towns; and from Frascati to Genzano and in
the Lake Nemi chain of villages&mdash;Rocca di
Papa, Castel Gandolpho, Ariccia, Albano&mdash;these
villages within some fifteen miles of Rome.
In these there is a veritable stronghold of Socialism,
where its purposes and policy are entrenched.
Yet when one alludes to its policy,
the term is rather too definite. If it had a
settled and well-formulated policy on which all
its adherents were in absolute accord they would
carry all before them. But Socialism is still a
very elastic term and covers, if not a multitude
of sins, at least a multitude of ideas and
ideals. There is now a rumor that the situation
is forcing the absolutely inconceivable union
of church and state&mdash;of the Vatican and the
Quirinale&mdash;that they may thus withstand their
common foe. A more amazing and extraordinary
turn of affairs could not be imagined; and
if the rumor (which is now becoming more coherent
in Rome) should prove to be the forerunner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
of any truth, the situation will be one of
the most amazing in all history.</p>

<p>Epoch-making events in the course of progress
are always preceded by circumstances that
form to them a natural approach and chain of
causation. They are the results of which the
causes stretch backward in the past. One of
the things that has an incalculably determining
influence on the present situation is that of the
character of the present Pope. His Holiness,
Pius X, brings to the Papacy an entirely new
element. He is no ascetic or exclusive ecclesiastic;
he is no diplomat or intriguant, but rather
a simple, kindly man, of a simplicity totally
unprecedented in the annals of the Palazzo
Vaticano. Instead of clinging with unswerving
intensity of devotion to the idea of the restoration
of the temporal power of the church, Pope
Pius X would not be disinclined to the uniting
of church and state as in England; the Vatican
to remain, like the See of Canterbury, the acknowledged
head of the spiritual power, while
the Quirinale remained the head of the government
to which the church should give its political
adherence, the Quirinale in return giving
to the Vatican its religious adherence. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
it is not too much to say that something not
unlike this might easily become&mdash;if it is not
already&mdash;the dream of Pius X. But in the
mean time there is another factor with which to
reckon, and that is the present Papal Secretary
of State, Cardinal Merry del Val. He it is who
really holds the mystic key of St. Peter&rsquo;s. He
is a diplomatist, an ecclesiastic, an embodiment
of all that is severe and archaic in authority.
The Pope is by no means able to set his course
by his own watch-lights. The College of Cardinals
surrounds him, and the College of Cardinals
is practically one Cardinal, the keen
scholar and the all determining Cardinal Merry
del Val, whose personality dominates the court
of the Vatican. This remarkable prelate represents
the most advanced and progressive
thought of the day in many ways,&mdash;as has
been noted in preceding pages,&mdash;but as a
Jesuit he is unalterably devoted to what he considers
the only ideal,&mdash;the restoration of the
temporal power of the Pope. Spain revealed
her attitude when King Alphonso asked of all
the monarchs of Europe that the name of each
should be borne by his infant son, the heir-apparent;
and for Italy he asked the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
the Pope and not of the King, thus recognizing
Pius X rather than Victor Emmanuel III as
the head of the nation.</p>

<p>That the Socialists have very logical and
serious grounds for complaint is true. That
their leader, Signor Enrico Ferri, an Italian
journalist and a Senator, is one of the most
able men in Italy since the time of Cavour is
equally undeniable. The Socialists are fortunate,
too, in other leading men. <a name="tn436" id="tn436"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Zurati'">Turati</ins>, the
editor of the <i>Critica Sociale</i>, Pantaleoni, Colajanni,
and others are absolutely the hope of
Italy at the present time in the struggle for better
conditions. For the conditions of life in
Italy, as regards taxation, the problems of transit,
the government restrictions on agricultural
production and on manufactures, are absolutely
intolerable and should not be endured for a
day. The taxation is so exorbitant that it is a
marvel Italy is not depopulated. On land the tax
rate is from thirty to fifty per cent; the income
tax is not merely, as one would suppose, levied
on a legitimate income derived from a man&rsquo;s possessions,
but is levied on salaries, ranging from
ten to twenty per cent of these, and also, not
content with this unheard-of extortion, the tax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
is levied on the nature and source of his salary,
and even the smallest wage is thus subject to
an income tax. Again, there is a most absurd
tax on salt, which, like sugar and tobacco, is
held as a government monopoly. No poor person
living on the seacoast in Italy is allowed to
take even a pail of water from the sea to his
house, as the government assumes that, by evaporation,
it might yield a few grains of salt. The
tax on sugar effectually checks an industry that
might be made most profitable, that of putting
up fruit in jams, jellies, and compote, and renders
the price of these commodities absurdly
high. Again, when taxes are paid the process
is even worse than the unjust and exorbitant
tax itself. No one is allowed to send a check
or postal order; no tax gatherer calls at the
home or the office. Each person must go himself
or send a personal representative to a given
place between certain hours. Here stand a long
procession, each person in town going up, filling
out pages of written formalities; talking of each
item and discussing it according to the national
custom, until the office hours are over for that
day, and often not one-fourth of the persons
waiting have been served. All then must take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
their chances the next day, and perhaps even a
third or a fourth day,&mdash;a loss of time and
energy that in no other country would be tolerated
for a moment. But time has not yet
any recognizable value in Italy. Every enterprise
and manufacture is taxed in Italy, and as
the returns of these are inevitably revealed so
that no evasion is possible, and as the exactions
of the government consume nearly all the profits,
the result is that all business enterprises are discouraged
and that Italy swarms with a great
idle population, while nearly all articles and
supplies are imported from other countries, with
the payment of enormous duties, making their
cost far greater, proportionately, than their
value.</p>

<p>There are great tracts of country in Southern
Italy suitable for tobacco raising, but (as it is
one of the government monopolies) people are
forbidden to raise it; and in private gardens
only three plants are permitted. Again, all industries
are crippled, if not paralyzed, by the
tax at the frontier, and also by the tax at every
gate of every city. At every <i>porta</i> in Rome
are stationed government officers who scrutinize
every box, basket, and package; and all fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
eggs, garden stuff, milk, and commodities of
every kind are taxed as they are brought inside
the walls.</p>

<p>The railroads of Italy are, at present, very
poor in all facilities of transit. Within a year
the Italian government has &ldquo;taken over&rdquo; these
roads and better conditions are promised, which
are, alas! not yet in sight. There are many
&ldquo;counts&rdquo; to the indictment against the Italian
railroads which are only suitable to adorn the
very lowest circles of the Inferno described by
Dante. They are uncleanly; the roadbeds are
so rough that the miserably built compartments
jolt and jostle over the tracks; the seats are so
high that the feet can hardly touch the floor,
and the facilities for light and air are as badly
managed as is possible to conceive. As is well
known, these are divided into first, second, and
third class, these compartments all being in
the same train, and between the first and second
there is little difference save that of price.
Curiously, the price of even second-class travelling
in Italy is over half a cent a mile higher
than that of the splendid trains in America,
with their swift time, their smooth roadbeds,
their admirable conveniences in every way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
Again, no luggage is carried free, and the prices
asked for it are extortionate beyond words.
One may check all his impedimenta from San
Francisco to New York without extra charge;
but in going from Rome to Naples, or from
Florence to Genoa to sail, the same luggage will
cost from six to eight dollars to convey it to
the steamer. Again, these railroads pay their
employ√©s so poorly that only the most inefficient
service can be retained at all; only those
persons who are the absolute prisoners of poverty
will consent to accept such meagrely paid
service.</p>

<p>The Italian government consists, like that of
most countries, of an upper and lower house,
the Senate and the House of Deputies. But the
former is rather a matter of miscellaneous honors
than one of political initiative. There is no
limit to the number of Senators; they are created
by being named by the King, and the office is
for life. If a man attracts the favorable notice of
the King,&mdash;because he is a good artist, engineer,
arch√¶ologist, chemist, or financier,&mdash;presto, he
is liable to be made a Senator. Canova, the
celebrated sculptor, was made a Senator because,
indeed, he was a great artist! There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
is one condition, however, that a Senator
must be one who pays annually not less than
three thousand lire in taxes. The Senators receive
no salary, and their times of meeting are
uncertain and no man&rsquo;s presence is obligatory.
The House of Deputies has five hundred and
eight members, all of whom must be Italian
subjects over thirty years of age. They have no
salary, but are given the entire freedom of the
realm in all transit on railroads and steamers.
The Chamber of Deputies is largely made up
of professional men, and it is little wonder
that the Socialists are demanding an entire
reform in the government of the country.
There was never in any country more defective
conditions than now prevail in Italy. The very
fact that the young King is an estimable gentleman,
who is personally not in the least to blame
for the prevailing status of unfortunate conditions,
is in one way an added misfortune, as
the personal loyalty he justly inspires militates
by so much against the revolution in government
which is so deeply a necessity of Italy
before her better and more prosperous life can
begin. It is now a country of stagnation. All
Southern and Central Italy simply lives off its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
tourists; and every year prices and fees and
extortion in general from the visitors to Italy
become greater.</p>

<p>Senator Enrico Ferri, the leader of Socialism
in Italy, was born in 1856 in Mantua. He had
a university education, was admitted to the bar,
and in 1881 was called to the chair of penal
law in the University of Bologna. The Senator
is a scientific Socialist,&mdash;a man of the most
exceptional gifts and qualities, and the author
of a noted work, entitled &ldquo;Criminal Sociology,&rdquo;
which is translated into several languages. Senators
Ferri and Lombroso are special friends
and also co-workers.</p>

<p>On taking his seat in the University of
Bologna, Professor Ferri delivered a lecture, entitled
&ldquo;New Horizons in Penal Law,&rdquo; which
was a most impressive effort. In it he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It was in this inaugural discourse that I
affirmed the existence of the positivist school of
criminal law, and assigned to it these two
fundamental rules: First, while the classical
schools of criminal law have always studied the
crime and neglected the criminal, the object of
the positivist school was, in the first place, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
study the criminal, so that, instead of the crime
being regarded merely as a juridical fact, it
must be studied with the aid of biology, of psychology,
and of criminal statistics as a natural
and social fact, transforming the old criminal
law into a criminal sociology. Secondly, while
the classical schools, since Beccaria and Howard,
have fulfilled the historic mission of decreasing
the punishments as a reaction from the severity
of the medi√¶val laws, the object of the positivist
school is to decrease the offence by investigating
its natural and social causes in order to
apply social remedies more efficacious and more
humane than the penal counteraction, always
slow in its effects, especially in its cellular system,
which I have called one of the aberrations
of the nineteenth century.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Such is the man to whom it is no extravagance
to allude as one of the present leaders of
progress in Italy. He is in the early prime of
mature life; he is a man of education, culture,
great original gifts, and of sympathies with humanity
as wise and judicious as they are liberal
and all-embracing. Scientific Socialism tolerates
no lawlessness, no violence, nor does it, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
the so-called Christian Socialism, attempt to
graft impossible conditions on society. It regards
the laws of economics, and it is practicable
and possible as well as considerate
and just. And the great inspirer, proclaimer,
and leader of scientific Socialism is Enrico
Ferri.</p>

<p>Italy not only inspires the enthusiasm of the
lover of beauty in nature and art, she inspires
a vital and abiding interest in all that shall
make for her true progress, and she inspires, as
well, absolute faith in her ultimate future. At
present her monarchy is among the most liberal
and progressive of Europe. King Victor Emmanuel
is a man of integrity, of intelligence, and
of devotion to the best interests of his country
as he understands these interests to be. If they
might be better served by a more democratic
form of government, it is hardly to be asked
or expected that such a view should present
itself to an hereditary monarch. Among the
most liberal element there are not wanting men
who believe that for the immediate future the
present form of government is the most feasible.
In their conviction Italy is by no means prepared
to be a republic. The masses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
people are uneducated; and a great work, requiring
time, must be effected in the popularization
of intelligence and of instruction, before
democratic government could be adopted. Yet
there is no faltering in the outlook on a glorious
future. The noble words of Mazzini still
ring in the Italian air: &ldquo;Walk in faith, and fear
not. Believe, and you will conquer.&rdquo; By way
of enforcing his convictions Mazzini said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Upon a day in the sixteenth century, at
Rome, some men bearing the title of <i>Inquisitors</i>,
who assumed to derive wisdom and authority
from God himself, were assembled to decree
the immobility of the earth. A prisoner stood
before them. His brow was illumined by genius.
He had outstripped time and mankind, and revealed
the secret of a world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Galileo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man shook his bold and venerable
head. His soul revolted against the absurd violence
of those who sought to force him to deny
the truths revealed to him by God. But his
pristine energy was worn down by long suffering
and sorrow; the monkish menace crushed
him. He strove to submit. He raised his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
he too, to declare the immobility of the earth.
But as he raised his hand, he raised his weary
eyes to that heaven they had searched throughout
long nights to read thereon one line of the
universal law; they encountered a ray of that
sun which he so well knew motionless amid the
moving spheres. Remorse entered his heart: an
involuntary cry burst from the believer&rsquo;s soul:
<i>Eppur si muove!</i> and yet it moves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three centuries have passed away. Inquisitors,&mdash;inquisition,&mdash;absurd
theses imposed by
force,&mdash;all these have disappeared. Naught
remains but the well-established movement of
the earth, and the sublime cry of Galileo floating
above the ages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child of Humanity, raise thy brow to the
sun of God, and read upon the heavens: <i>It
moves.</i> Faith and action! The future is ours.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Poetry,&rdquo; added Mazzini, &ldquo;will teach the
young the nobleness of sacrifice, of constancy,
and silence; of feeling one&rsquo;s self alone without
despairing, in an existence of suffering unknown
or misunderstood; in long years of bitterness,
wounds, and delusion, endured without murmur
or lament; it will teach them to have faith in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
things to come, and to labor unceasingly to
hasten their coming, even though without hope
of living to witness their triumph;&rdquo; and his
final word in this great invocation to the new
potencies of the opening future is an exhortation
to believe in all greatness and goodness.
&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which is intellect, energy,
and love, will put an end to the discords existing
in a society which has neither church nor
leaders; which invokes a new world, but forgets
to ask its secret, its Word, from God.&rdquo; In
universal education must lie the first national
aid to the development of Italy. &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;anima del
gran mondo √® l&rsquo;allegria.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Florence is pre-eminently the city of culture,
so is Milan of activities. Her keynote is
<i>modernit√©</i>. The visitor is at once impressed by
her energy, her enterprise, and her commercial
prosperity. Milan has the best municipal facilities
and conveniences in all Italy. The electric
lighting of streets, public buildings, and
residences, the street transit, the arrangement
and conduct of shops and all industrial matters,
are in such contrast to any other city in Italy
as to lead the sojourner to ask himself whether
he can still be on the southern side of the Alpine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
range. In the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele
Milan has the most wonderful structure in all
Europe. This arcade was built in 1865, and
under the magnificent glass dome it includes
nearly one hundred of the most attractive
and well-stocked shops, bazaars, and establishments.
The dome is decorated with frescoes
and caryatides, and with the statues of numbers
of eminent men, among whom are Dante,
Raphael, Savonarola, and Cavour. The offices
and banks in Milan are centres of incessant
energy.</p>

<p>For all this stress of activity the visitor does
not, however, forget the art features; the visit
to the antique Church of St. Ambrosio; to the
old convent where Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s celebrated
fresco, &ldquo;The Last Supper,&rdquo; is to be
seen, though so faded that it is now difficult
to discern all the figures. Nor does he fail to
climb the wonderful cathedral that lifts its airy
grace, as if about to float upward in the skies.
Every flight of the steps, in the ascent, brings
one to a new vision of beauty. On the roof of
this cathedral one wanders as in a very forest
of sculpture. Its scheme of decoration includes
more than two thousand statues, two of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
are by Canova. From the summit, when the air
is clear, there are beautiful views of the Alps.</p>

<p>To the savant and scholar the Ambrosian
library in Milan is one of the special treasures
of Europe. It contains some of the most rare
and valuable manuscripts in the entire world,&mdash;some
of Virgil&rsquo;s with annotations from Petrarcha;
a manuscript of Dante&rsquo;s; drawings by
Leonardo da Vinci, and other interesting matters
of which no other copies exist.</p>

<p>The Magic Land is seen under its most bewitching
spell in the region of the Italian lakes.
The palace of Isola Bella; the charming gardens;
the lake of Como, green-walled in hills
whose luxuriant foliage and bloom form a
framework for the white villas that cluster on
their terraced slopes,&mdash;all form a very fairyland
of ethereal, rose-embowered beauty. At night
the lakes are a strange, unreal world of silver
lights and shadows.</p>

<p>The completion of the Simplon tunnel has
opened between Italy and Paris a route not
only offering swifter facilities for transit, but
adding another to the regions of beauty. This
route has also still further increased the commercial
importance of Milan, the portal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
metropolis of Northern Italy. Milan has become
the national centre of all scientific and
technical pursuits, and it is fairly the Mecca for
young men of Central and Southern Italy who
are entering into the professions, or into civil
and electrical engineering and other of the
technical arts and industries.</p>

<p>Bologna, with her historic University, with
the long covered arcades of the streets, the
fountain, which is the work of Giovanni di
Bologna, and the gallery where many of Guido&rsquo;s
best works are placed, has its individual interest
for the tourist; and Verona, Pavia, Modena,
Parma, and Turin all repay a visit from the
leisurely saunterer in Italy.</p>

<p>Pisa offers to the visitor four interesting
architectural monuments in the Duomo, the
Baptistery, the Leaning Tower, and the Campo
Santo, all of which are unique. The cathedral
has unique designs in its black and white
marbles that render it almost as much an object
of artistic study as is the cathedral in
Siena. The view from the summit of the Leaning
Tower reveals the Mediterranean six miles
in the distance, gleaming like a sea of silver.
The Campo Santo dates from the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
century, when the earth of which it is composed
was brought (in 1228) from the holy places
in Jerusalem, conveyed to the city (then a seaport)
by fifty galleys sent out by the Republic
of Pisa. The interior walls of the Campo
Santo are covered with fresco paintings by
Orcagna which are one of the artistic spectacles
of the country in their extravagant portrayal
of theological beliefs, so realistically
presented in their dramatic scenes from Paradise
and from Hades, as to leave nothing to the
imagination. The fantasies in this emblematic
sculpture of memorial monuments over a period
of seven hundred years can be seen in the
Campo Santo of Pisa,&mdash;a strange and often a
most grotesque medley.</p>

<p>Genoa is well named La Superba. Her
thoroughfares are streets of palaces. Her terraced
gardens and villas, reached by the subterranean
funicular street railway, are regions
of unique and incomparable beauty, with the
blue Mediterranean at their feet. Genoa is the
paradise for walking. The streets are largely
inaccessible to carriages, but the admirable
street electric railway penetrates every locality.
It passes in dark tunnels under the hills, reappears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
on the high terraces, and climbs every
height. From the crest of one of these Corsica
can often be seen. All the hill-slopes are a
dream of pictorial grandeur, with their terraces,
their palaces, their sculpture, fountains, and
flowers. On the summit of almost every hill
there is a fortress, and often ramparts which are
silhouetted, in dark masses, against the sky.
Orange groves abound on the terraces, often
showing the golden fruit, buds, and blossoms
all at the same time.</p>

<p>Genoa is fairly a metropolis of sculpture.
The great families have themselves perpetuated
in portrait statues rather than in painted portraits.
In one of the grand ducal palaces in
the Via Balbi the visitor may see, not only the
life-size statues and the busts of the family ancestry,
but one group comprising nine figures,
where three generations are represented, in
both sitting and standing poses, ingeniously
combined.</p>

<p>The churches of Genoa are among the richest
in Europe. That of the <a name="tn452" id="tn452"></a><ins class="correction" title="original: 'Annunziati'">Annunziata</ins>, the
special monument of the Lomellini family,
glitters and gleams with its gold ceilings and
rich frescoes. The cathedral has the special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
allurement of the emerald dish which King
Solomon received as a gift from the Queen of
Sheba. The little &ldquo;street of the jewellers&rdquo; is
an alluring place,&mdash;so narrow that one can almost
stand in the centre of the road and touch
the shop windows on either hand, and these
windows dazzle the eye with their fascinating
glitter of gold and silver filigree work and their
rich jewels.</p>

<div class="figcenter border" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/genoab.jpg"><img src="images/genoa.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="CAMPO SANTO, GENOA" title="CAMPO SANTO, GENOA" /></a>
<p class="caption noi"><small>CAMPO SANTO, GENOA</small></p>
</div>

<p>Beyond all other curious excursions that even
a Magic Land can offer is that to the Campo
Santo of Genoa. A cloistered promenade encloses
a square, and above are terraced colonnades,
each and all revealing statues, and
monuments, and groups of sculpture whose
varied beauty, oddity, or bizarre effects are a
curious study. Some memorials&mdash;as one of
an angel with outstretched wings; another of
a flight of angels bearing the soul away; another
combining the figure of Christ with the cross,
and angels hovering near&mdash;are full of beauty.
Others are a marvel of ingenious and incongruous
combination. One of the latter represents
the man whose memory it commemorates as
lying on his bed in his last illness; the physician
stands by, his fingers on the patient&rsquo;s pulse; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the opposite side a maid is approaching with a
dish holding some article of food, and near the
physician are grouped the wife, with a little
child clinging to her skirts; the son, holding
his hat with both hands and looking down on
it, and the daughter, a young girl, with her
eyes raised to heaven. Each of these figures is
in life size; the bed is reproduced in marble,
with the pillows and all the coverings in the
most absolute realism, and the entire effect is
so startling in its bizarre aspect that one could
hardly believe in its existence until by personal
observation he had verified so singular a monument.</p>

<p>Yet there is beauty and symbolic loveliness,
too, in many of the memorial sculptures of this
Campo Santo, and turning away from this
cemetery in which lies the body of the noble
Mazzini, one hears on the air the refrain of
his words on Dante:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;It appeared to him of more importance to
hasten to accomplish his mission upon earth,
than to meditate upon the inevitable hour which
marks for all men the beginning of a new
task. And if at times he speaks of weariness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
of life, it is only because he sees evil more and
more triumphant in the places where his mission
was appointed. He concerned himself, not
about the length or the shortness of life, but
about the end for which life was given; for he
felt God in life, and knew the creative virtue
there is in action.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Eighty thousand people followed Mazzini to
his tomb, and his name lives in the Italy of
to-day as one to be associated with that of
Dante as prophet and inspirer.</p>

<p>The enchantment of approaching Genoa from
the sea at night is an experience to remain as
one of the pictorial treasures of memory. The
magnificent <i>lanterna</i>, the lighthouse with its revolving
light, that can be seen for fifty miles
out from the coast; the brilliant illumination
defining the <i>fortezza</i> on the summit of one hill;
the curving lights of the terraced residential
district and the illumination of the very forest
of shipping clustered in the bay,&mdash;all combine
into a scene not easily effaced from the memories
of foreign scenes.</p>

<p>It is only in close relations with Italian literature
that Italy can be adequately enjoyed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
that the sojourner may enter into sympathetic
associations with contemporary Italian life. Dr.
Richard Garnett believes that the literature of
Italy &ldquo;is a less exhaustive manifestation than
elsewhere of the intellect of the nation,&rdquo; and
that &ldquo;the best energies of the country are employed
in artistic production. It is, indeed,
remarkable,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;that out of the nine
Italians most brilliantly conspicuous in the first
rank of genius and achievement,&mdash;Aquinas,
Dante, Columbus, Leonardo, Michael Angelo,
Raphael, Titian, Galileo, Napoleon,&mdash;only one
should have been a man of letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Contemporary Italian literature follows the
trend of the day in reflecting the life of the
people. The novels of Fogazzaro, the poems
of Carducci, the biography and history written
by Villari, to say nothing of several other
writers who, while not approaching these authors,
have still a definite place in the literature
of the present, offer illumination on the outer
scenery of life, and offer interpretation of the
life itself. Art has declined; literature has advanced
in Italy, even within the past decade.
The law of progress is as inevitable as is the law
of gravitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Onward the chariot of the Unvarying moves;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor day divulges him nor night conceals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hear&rsquo;st the echo of unreturning hooves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And thunder of irrevocable wheels.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The future of Italy inspires faith in the renewal
of its noblest ideals of achievement. Its
ineffable beauty is a heritage of joy to every
visitor who comes under the indescribable spell
of its attraction and finds that, in all the panorama
of foreign life which haunts his memory,
it is Italy which shines resplendent as the
Magic Land!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>
